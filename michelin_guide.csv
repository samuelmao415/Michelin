"Zum Stammtisch","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.zumstammtisch.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Family owned and operated since 1972, this unrelenting success story has expanded over the years and welcomed Stammtisch Pork Store & Imports next door. Zum Stammtisch hosts a crowded house in a Bavarian country inn setting where old-world flavor is relished with whole-hearted enthusiasm. The goulash is thick and hearty, stocked with potatoes and beans, but that's just for starters. Save room for sauerbraten, jägerschnitzel, or a platter of succulent grilled sausages that includes bratwurst, knockwurst, and hickory-smoked krainerwurst served with sauerkraut and potato salad. The Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (classic Black Forest cake) layers dense chocolate sponge with Kirsch-soaked cherries and cream, and is absolutely worth the indulgence."
"Zoma","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.zomanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Smart, cool, modern, and always welcoming, Zoma may well be this city's most serious Ethiopian restaurant. The crowded bar emits a golden light from below to showcase its premium spirits, and the ambient dining room is filled with locals from this thriving community. Attention to detail is clear from the steaming hot towel for cleaning your hands to the carefully folded injera used for scooping up their chopped salads, chunky stews, and saucy vegetables. Unusual starters might include green lentils with a cold and crunchy mix of onions, jalapeños, ginger, white pepper, and mustard seeds. The doro watt-a chicken dish of the Amhara people-is a very traditional stew with a berbere sauce of sun-dried hot peppers and ground spices."
"ZZ's Clam Bar","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.zzsclambar.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","If you forget about your bank statement, don’t arrive faint with hunger, and leave your cynicism at the door—you’ll love ZZ’s Clam Bar. With just four marble tables and a small counter, this is as intimate as it gets. But you first have to navigate the bouncer at the door who’ll only allow admittance with a reservation. This at least ensures that, when you’re inside this bijou spot, the door doesn’t swing open every minute. Once in, you’re handed a cocktail list—these are, without doubt, some of the best in town and fully justify the lofty prices. The short seafood menu comes with a couple of choices under headings like “crudo,” “seared” and “ceviche.” Before you do anything else, order the trout roe on toast—it’s a beautiful thing and will linger long in the memory. This is not the place for everyone. Some won't see past some of the more pretentious elements and affectations and the prices can be eye-watering-the Chianina beef carpaccio comes in at over $100. However, judicious ordering before you plunge into the cocktails, like having clams instead of caviar, can at least keep your final bill from escalating too wildly. It also helps that the place is run with considerable charm, patience and care."
"zero otto nove","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.roberto089.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This Arthur Avenue favorite is easily recognized by the powder-blue FIAT parked outside, but is better appreciated for the wood-burning dome oven. Brick and cement archways, high ceilings, and a second-floor dining terrace strive to keep that oven-and its wares-within each table's line of vision. The menu showcases Salerno-style cooking with pizzas, baked pastas, and wood-fired entrées. In fact, any dish that is ""al cartoccio"" (in parchment) is sure to please. Open up this pouch to try the pitch-perfect al dente radiatori baked with porcini, cherry tomatoes, breadcrumbs, and loads of deliciously spicy sausage. The ragù Salernitano is a gut-busting triumph of stewed braciole, sausage, and tender meatballs. The Nutella calzone makes a sweet, rich finish."
"Zenkichi","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.zenkichi.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Though this Japanese standby might have seemed more novel a few years ago, Zenkichi still retains plenty of magic. The atmosphere is relaxed but focused, and the omakase is surprisingly well-priced for this neighborhood. Secluded booths offer a sexy vibe for date night, where couples can ring a bell for service. And Akariba, a cool little cash-only bar next door that is connected to the restaurant, serves up such treats as oysters and sake. In addition to the à la carte and dessert menus, this kitchen also offers three variations on omakase: traditional, vegetarian, and wheat-free. But unlike the typical omakase, there's something here for everyone, and the pre-determined dishes may unveil Saikyo miso cod or a heap of summer vegetables in Tosazu gelée."
"Minetta Tavern","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.minettatavernny.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","While this circa 1937 setting has been restored and refreshed, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. This quintessential New York tavern is still surrounded by dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, and those framed caricatures. The astute service team handles the crowds and energy as well as ever—they even don the same white-aproned livery seen in Mad Men. It’s that kind of place. The menu’s dedication to bistro classics (like oxtail and foie gras terrine) and New York steakhouse staples ensure its longevity. Trust them to prepare a steak tartare that is beyond textbook perfect, comprised here of pristine beef tenderloin, anchovy, capers and more, crowned with a tiny quail’s egg. This kitchen has a way with meat that goes far beyond the burger on everyone’s lips, thanks to beef that promises the deep, telltale flavors of dry-aging. Their massive pork chop draped in sauce charcutière has an intense crust that is blackened but never burnt, concealing a juicy interior that is no small feat for such a large piece of meat. The bittersweet chocolate soufflé is, was, and probably always will be crowd-pleasing and delicious, especially when served with a melting scoop of Bourbon-pecan ice cream."
"The Red Cat","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.theredcat.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If crowds indicate quality (and downtown they often do) then this clear favorite is still going strong, after almost 20 years. Loyal customers as diverse as the city itself flood this long bar and richly colored room for lunch, dinner, or just for a finely mixed cocktail and snack. Flowers give the space a touch of luxury; Moorish lanterns add warmth. The pleasures here are the straightforward items, which arrive courtesy of Chef/owner Jimmy Bradley. Begin with umami-rich and visually stunning roasted broccoli, finished with slivered almonds and parmesan shavings, before moving on to a crisped tranche of salmon crowned with peekytoe crab in creamy saffron aïoli. Finish in style with a perfectly composed pistachio semifreddo draped with dark chocolate sauce."
"Novitá","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.novitanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Enjoyable and quietly elegant, Novitá boasts a genuine Italian sensibility both in setting and service. The small size and low ceilings foster a surprisingly serene ambience that is all but disappearing in the city. Prices are not cheap, but the quality is high. The cooking does not necessarily break new ground, but is nonetheless good. Rather than explore the costlier dishes that perhaps feature Kobe beef or black truffles, it's best to stick to the tried-and-true favorites. Start with a superb combination of pan-fried shiitake caps filled with shrimp and scallions. Then, move on to tiny orechiette mingled with just the right amount of slow-cooked and fiery lamb ragù, broccoli rabe, and grated cheese. The espresso-soaked tiramisu is a perfect pick-me-up."
"L'Antagoniste","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.lantagoniste.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","From the razor-sharp service staff and its charming décor (think elegantly set wood tables and banquettes), to the killer but notably traditional French menu, everything about this buzzing hangout in burgeoning Bed-Stuy is bang-on. The fact that it is surrounded by bodegas and a fast food joint simply adds to the overall intrigue. Owner Amadeus Broger is the master of operations here and appears to have just one, single formula in mind-and that is to churn out serious food in a fun and convivial setting. Don't miss the soufflé au fromage, rendered light and frothy with nutty Comté; the tournedos Rossini, tender filet mignon over a potato pancake, topped with foie gras medallions and finished with Madeira; or the perfectly executed duck a l'orange."
"Hudson Garden Grill","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.nybg.org/visit/hudson-garden-grill.php","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There are many reasons why this is such an exciting partnership between The New York Botanical Garden and Chef Julian Alonzo, not the least of which is the idyllic setting. It is situated within sight of the landmarked Haupt Conservatory, open and airy, where huge arched windows overlook the manicured lawns. The menu is polished, makes the most of locally sourced ingredients, and exceeds expectations with delicious cooking that is as beautiful as the surroundings. Start with chewy, savory monkey bread served with honey butter in a cast-iron pan, then move on to tender and buttery crab cakes with pickled cucumbers, sea beans, and mustard seeds. The only disappointment maybe that it keeps the same hours as the NYBT, so this is a lunch-only treat."
"Kurumazushi","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kurumazushi.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Mimicking Tokyo's tucked-away restaurant style, this sushi destination is located up a dark staircase in a midtown building and through a sliding door. The focal point of the room is the sushi bar, where Chef/owner Toshihiro Uezu meticulously prepares each morsel in a minimal space. For the full theatrical experience, brace your wallet and settle into the omakase. The undeniable quality of each ingredient is center stage, displayed simply on glazed pottery. Take a cue from the Japanese and limit conversation: the succession of sashimi and sushi is quick, and all senses should work together without distraction to savor the smooth, buttery fatty tuna, Spanish mackerel (with its lightly blistered skin), pearly white sea bream, and rich unagi."
"Gotham Bar and Grill","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.gothambarandgrill.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","“Reliability” may be not be the sexiest adjective with which to describe a restaurant but that is exactly what you can expect from Gotham Bar and Grill. Whether you’re hosting family, entertaining clients or just out with friends, this is a restaurant where you know you don’t have to worry about it matching up to your hopes and expectations. The large, warmly lit room comes with just the right amount of glamour to add to any sense of occasion and is helmed by a personable team who make every diner feel like they’re in safe hands. This is also the type of establishment that exudes New York from its every pore—and is ideal for those for whom eating out is a visceral pleasure, rather than something to be photographed, posted and blogged. The cooking walks a pleasing line between comforting and creative and never feels faddish or contrived. In a refreshing break from current mores, dishes are more about flavor than presentation-and their size bears witness to the largesse of the kitchen. The miso-marinated black cod may look daunting when it arrives but is effortlessly easy to eat; the peanut butter sundae balances sweetness and saltiness in a joyful concoction of creaminess."
"db Bistro Moderne","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.dbbistro.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chef Daniel Boulud's midtown canteen is fashioned by Jeffrey Beers and dons a contemporary demeanor. The front lounge is abuzz with post-work and pre-theater gaggles, while well-behaved crowds in the back are seated in a walnut-paneled space dressed with mirrors and black-and-white photography. Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croute is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen, and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts, and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrates the kitchen's contemporary leanings."
"Cosme","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cosmenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chef Enrique Olvera's Cosme is dressed in a hip and urbane style that is perfectly suitable for its location. Of course, while the uni tostada is reason enough to visit this contemporary space, the sleek bar up front pouring a litany of stirring cocktails is yet another. Then add in the roomy dining room and soft lighting to its playful and modern Mexican cuisine, and you have quite a winning formula. One glance at the menu will also tell you why this kitchen is so beloved. A tempting tamal filled with broccoli purée and peppery arugula or crisped-skin duck carnitas served in a cast-iron skillet-this cooking is clever, and, at times, surprisingly delicate. Even desserts, like a pecan tart with salt-and-pepper ice cream, offer remarkable bursts of flavor."
"Bin 5","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bin5nyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","At this intimate bistro in Rosebank, dinner comes with a view of the Manhattan skyline. Complete with teardrop chandeliers and exposed brick, Bin 5's romantic setting has long drawn locals seeking good food and quiet conversation (plus that fantastic panorama!). The playful menu-complete with solid daily specials-may reveal a perfect pan-seared and golden-brown pork loin, set atop slices of pickled red and green peppers and surrounded by a generous amount of pan sauce made from prosecco and vinegar. Then, cauliflower florets are pulsed to form couscous-like beads and cooked in the style of fried rice, studded with veggies and seasoned by soy. A tall wedge of pistachio-walnut cake dusted with powdered sugar is a light, fluffy and fitting finale."
"Bevy","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.bevynyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Nestled inside the luxe Park Hyatt hotel, just across from Carnegie Hall, Bevy is a sultry rebuttal to the gray hustle-bustle of midtown. Inside, you’ll find a private-feeling dining room, where the magnanimous staff puts customers at ease with effortless service. Next door, a lively lounge offers some pre- or post-dinner fun. The kitchen doles out an expansive roster of dishes for its well-heeled patrons. While some go for the house specialty (a delicious roast chicken for two), others may opt for more hearty, upscale entrées like Maine lobster, rib eye, or Mangalitsa pork collar. Don't miss the Diver scallops though, served with Romesco sauce and a verdant watercress oil; or seasonal vegetables, highlighted in their own section of the menu."
"Beach Bistro 96","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.beachbistro96.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Helmed by Brazilian-born chef Carlos Varella and his wife, former model Andressa Junqueira, this tiny orange shack perched on the edge of the Atlantic feels more like Bahia than Rockaway Beach. Once an outer borough no-man's land in steady state of decline, the seaside Queens nabe-now a summertime destination for surfers and hipsters alike-is finally having its day in the sun. Beach Bistro 96 is basking in that glow with a decidedly laid-back vibe, walls lined in banana leaf print paper, and pristine, simple food that celebrates Brazil in all of its delicious glory. Don't head back to the surf without sampling the feijoada, a stew-like specialty bursting with pork and black beans; or the pasteis, golden-fried empanadas filled with tasty ground beef."
"Bell Book & Candle","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bbandcnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Funky, relaxed, and locally minded, the idea behind this farm-to-table style of dining might seem overdone if the cooking here wasn't so good. Enter carefully down a steep set of stairs to find low ceilings, large canvas artwork, and comfortable seating that lets you settle in and ponder just how very local the lettuce can be (answer: the rooftop). In fact, much of the produce here was harvested from their aeroponic rooftop gardens, while the rest is sourced from local purveyors. From start to finish, the American fare is consistently pleasing. Highlights include crispy fried P.E.I. oysters with jalapeño-buttermilk dressing, thick and juicy grilled sausage with house pickles and flatbread, and gooey chocolate brownies with pistachio ice cream."
"Beccofino","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.beccofinorestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Beccofino is an earnest neighborhood darling that is never taken for granted. Inside, string lights, exposed brick, and colorful, life-sized posters fashion a rustic bistro setting for indulging in their Italian-American favorites (with plenty of bread for sopping up sauces). Expect meals to be well-paced and the dedicated staff to ensure that everything is made to your liking. Some dishes stray from being genuinely Italian but are nonetheless popular and surprisingly good, like seafood-stuffed manicotti topped with a generous amount of shrimp bisque and mild mozzarella. A crowd-pleasing chicken Milanese arrives as an insanely savory cutlet, pounded thin and sautéed, topped with broccoli rabe, chili flakes, spicy tomato sauce, and more melting mozzarella."
"Beaubourg","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.beaubourgnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Talk about a room with a view. As part of the French market, Le District, Beaubourg sits on the banks of the Hudson, facing a wide promenade and a beautiful row of yachts. Diners linger over crisp French wine and excellent cheeses, soaking in the scene. It's a picture postcard in the making, but this brasserie is more than just a pretty face. Start with phenomenal house-made charcuterie-from the velvety foie gras to the dense terrines and creamy pâté de campagne, everything is luscious. The wonderful steak tartare, dressed with anchovy, briny capers, and a tiny, quivering quail egg, arrives with crispy pommes gaufrettes; and entrées like perfectly roasted chicken and delicate Dover sole in lemon butter make for a refined and elegant finish."
"Battersby","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.battersbybrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This intimate Smith Street stunner is the domain of Co-chefs Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern. The tiny kitchen at the back of the minimally decorated room belies the abundance of brilliance delivered by the short and sweet menu. Caserecci tossed with petite, al dente cauliflower florets, briny capers, sweet currants, and a showering of crunchy breadcrumbs is a treat. Choosing the smaller portion size allows for more room to enjoy the lamb duo-rare seared loin and slow-braised belly-composed with a chickpea-and-piquillo pepper stew slicked with delicious lamb jus. For dessert, the chocolate mille-feuille with mint ganache and Fernet Branca whipped cream is like a Thin Mint made by some very talented and very sophisticated Girl Scouts."
"Bâtard","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.batardtribeca.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","239 West Broadway will be a familiar address to those who know their restaurants as it has hosted a number of seminal establishments over the years—namely Montrachet and Corton.  Drew Nieporent’s Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker’s cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you’re expecting. You’ll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed."
"Barney Greengrass","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.barneygreengrass.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Bagels and bialys reign supreme in this culinary institution, set amid a culturally rich stretch dotted with synagogues and purveyors of authentic deli delights. Not all are created equal, though, and little details make all the difference inside this sturgeon king, lauded for its weathered décor featuring muraled walls, a storied past, and service that is as authentically NY as can be. It's the sort of spot families flock to for brunch-imagine a triple-decker (tongue, turkey, and Swiss cheese) on rye, paired with a pickle, of course. Whether you take-out or eat-in, items like chopped liver with caramelized onions and boiled egg are sure to sate. Finish with a black-and-white cookie, rugelach, or rice pudding, which are all local faves and fittingly so."
"Barbuto","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.barbutonyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","When New Yorkers dream of living in the West Village, Barbuto has a place in that dream, too. Springtime lunches with garage doors open to the sidewalk, and a feast of refined, simple dishes have earned Jonathan Waxman a devoted following in a neighborhood already full of charming restaurants. Casually professional service and the dimly lit dining room's dose of California cool enhance the experience. Barbuto's roast chicken deserves its legendary status, but other dishes tempt too. A cavolo nero salad of thinly sliced black kale and crunchy breadcrumbs tossed in a creamy dressing of anchovies and pecorino puts the average kale salad to shame. Linguini is then coated with black pepper, egg, pancetta, and cheese in one indelible plate of carbonara."
"Barbetta","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.barbettarestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It doesn't get more old-world New York than this iconic Restaurant Row institution. Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out: men are required to don dinner jackets, outerwear is mandatorily checked, and a brigade of starched servers flit about the hushed and gilded surrounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals. The kitchen's Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each selection is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine."
"Barawine","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.barawine.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Amid the leafy, brownstone-lined Mount Morris Park Historic District, Barawine is an inviting dining room overseen by Fabrice Warin (formerly the sommelier at Orsay). This eye-catching space entices Lenox Avenue passersby to step in, sip and sup, either perched at the bar area's communal table or seated in the quieter, more intimate back dining room. Whitewashed walls attractively double as wine storage throughout. The crowd-pleasing menu defies classification and embraces many influences. Quinoa salad with tofu and seaweed will please the disciplined, while mac and cheese loaded with béchamel, Gruyère, and diced ham calls out to more indulgent palates. Pan-seared branzino with aromatic herbs and a drizzle of balsamic is a treat for all."
"Barano","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.baranobk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Hot off the success of his time at Rubirosa in SoHo, Chef Al Di Meglio brings his distinctive take on the cooking of Ischia to Barano. The stylish stallion sits at the base of a new residential development, just a stone's throw from the East River. Inside, you'll find a smart décor featuring sepia mirrors, polished tables, and columns lined in pearly mosaic tiles. The vibrant bar, fully open kitchen, and wood-burning oven add to its appeal. Everything here is executed with great care, but the pasta and pizza are particularly noteworthy. Sensational nettle tortellini are tucked with mushrooms and bathed in a purée of mild spring garlic ramps and sweet peas; while tender bucatini are twirled with an irresistible rabbit ragù."
"Bar Uchū","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.uchu.nyc","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","This unexpected culinary diamond lies hidden behind a blonde wood door and right beside a graffiti-covered playground—its only sign is written in Japanese characters. It all feels very LES at Bar Uchū's kaiseki counter. Once inside, the elegance is unmistakable, starting with the warm towels that begin your meal to the paté de fruits that end it. The intricate beverage program is central to dining here, thoughtfully planned right down to the coasters. There is no open kitchen, but the prime seats are at the bar, where the entertaining bartenders are hand-shaving ice, pouring superb Japanese whiskeys, and filling coups with smoke. Of course, the foremost reason to dine here is for the exceptional kaiseki-style menu. Behind the kitchen's closed doors, Chef Samuel Clonts has emerged into this spotlight, straight from his training at Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare. The cuisine is heavily influenced by Japanese craftsmanship and incorporates a host of ingredients, many of which are grown in their rooftop garden. Luxe highlights include a Siberian sturgeon caviar handroll, Miyazaki Wagyu beef, and Hokkaido uni. Finales also astound by way of a soufflé with warm roasted strawberries and matcha ice cream."
"Bar Primi","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.barprimi.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Chef Sal Lamboglia and Chef/owner Andrew Carmellini clearly know what they wanted to do in this kitchen: make excellent Italian (and Italian-American) food with a delicious twist here and surprise ingredient there. The result is a restaurant we would all want to have just around the corner. Great wine, a friendly service team, and two floors of comfortable seating make it easy for guests to pile in, night after night. Start with meatballs, a far cry from the generic kind, stuffed with Fontina and braised until tender in a chunky tomato sugo. Pasta here rivals Italy, especially the spaghetti with small, briny clams and spicy 'njuda crumbles topped with breadcrumbs and parsley. Daily specials are also a delight, as is the simply delicious hazelnut gelato."
"Balthazar","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.balthazarny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","As ageless as its beautiful patrons, the brassy and mirrored Balthazar should be called ""quintessentially SoHo"" because it invented the term. One of the benchmark brasseries from serial restaurateur Keith McNally, the attractive space is housed in a former tannery. Those whiffs of leather have been replaced by red awnings, scents of pastries, and an excellent oyster-filled raw bar completing its Parisian transformation. It seems as though every other table is topped with their bestselling steak frites-hardly a value but expertly prepared and served with a heaping side of fries. On the delicate side, sautéed skate is served with sweet raisins and tart capers; while silky beef tartare with shallots, herbs, and Worcestershire spreads just like butta."
"Baker & Co.","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bakernco.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","With only a few years on the downtown circuit, this chic charmer is already a bonafide Village sweetheart. Brought to you by the team behind the wildly popular Emporio and Aurora, Baker & Co. is housed in the beloved and much-missed Zito & Sons Bakery-and the interior features a long, welcoming bar, cozy, wood-lined banquettes, as well as a vibrant red-and-white mosaic floor. The kitchen smartly relies on the same formula that put their other outposts on the map: honest, unfussy Italian rendered with a deft hand and deep attention to ingredients. Consider the luscious burrata, paired with pencil-thin roasted asparagus, cured fish roe and a drizzle of salsa verde; or the tender branzino with asparagus, toasted hazelnuts, arugula and chili flakes."
"Bahari estiatorio","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.bahariestiatorio.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Astoria is awash in good Greek food, but Bahari estiatorio still sets itself apart. Hiding behind an unassuming façade, the dining room is clean, generously sized and simple-think exposed red brick, white walls, and tables draped with paper placemats featuring the Greek Isles. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Everything on the menu here is a temptation, but a collection of traditional casserole dishes under the mageirefta portion of the menu offers the coziest of baked Greek dishes. One example, saganaki methysmeno, arrives bubbling with caramelized kefalograviera cheese and a tomato-red wine sauce. Papatsouki, or tender roasted eggplant stuffed with ground beef and a layer of fluffy caramelized béchamel, is deliciously decadent."
"Babbo","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.babbonyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","While a restaurant can rarely be all things to all people, it should certainly adapt to the various needs and moods of its customers. Come for lunch at Babbo, for example, and there’ll be Stan Getz playing gently in the background to accompany the quiet clinking of cutlery and the soft murmur of conversation. Turn up for dinner with friends and Led Zeppelin or Tom Petty will be the soundtrack to the far more excitable vibe. Mario Batali’s Village stalwart is a thoroughbred now heading inexorably towards its 20th birthday. The reason for its longevity is pretty apparent as soon as you walk in: the place just feels right, everything they do they have practiced, and every need you have and every request you make will be accommodated. It’s also a decidedly handsome space, with the first floor room adorned with fresh flowers and a staircase leading to a bright, raised second level. The menu offers a comprehensive selection of Italian dishes whose rustic appearance belies their skilled creation. The homemade pasta dishes are an obvious strength and the kitchen can show a remarkably light touch when required, especially with certain classic desserts like panna cotta."
"Awadh","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.awadhnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Awadh isn't an ordinary Indian spot, but one that advertises faithful flavors from Uttar Pradesh. This Northern Indian region excels in low- and slow-cooked dum pukht dishes, and the menu reads like a study in authenticity (there's no tandoori chicken in sight). Even the small room, polished and modern, is ideal for the city's well-traveled locals. Top service and table settings further elevate the dining experience here, which begins with aloo chutney pulao or basmati rice scattered with silky potatoes and spiced peas. Couple this with nali ki nihari (perfectly pink lamb in a creamy cardamom-infused curry) or khaas chicken korma rich with nuts for a profound and regal repast. Then cool down over minty pudina raita, and just like that, you've become a regular."
"Bacaro","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.bacaronyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Heavy iron candelabras, crumbling stone walls, and communal wooden tables lend a sultry vibe to this underground labyrinth, named for a Venetian bacaro (or counter for casual grazing of snacks and wine). The first floor's marble-topped bar beckons for small bites and a glass of wine, while nooks beneath those low stone ceilings in the downstairs dining room call for a romantic evening over candlelight. Crafted by Frank DeCarlo, the same chef/owner of Peasant in NoLita, Bacaro's menu highlights the best of Venetian cuisine. Bigoli con sugo d'anatra brings together whole-wheat pasta with tender, pulled duck, a tomato-cream sauce, and shavings of salty parmesan. For dessert, the velvety flourless chocolate cake topped with dried apricots, is as decadent as the setting."
"Avant Garden","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.avantgardennyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This tight but artsy little jewel box of a restaurant, courtesy of Ravi DeRossi, aims to give vegan food some well-deserved polish. Avant Garden's dynamic menu couldn't have arrived at a better time, as New York diners are hungry for more upscale meatless options. This is excellent food that just happens to be vegan. Try the cold, salt-baked sweet potato with puréed watercress, crispy jicama and Meyer lemon; or avocado, paired with white asparagus, crunchy radishes, strawberries, and garlicky grilled ramps. Sheets of pasta are tossed with pesto, tomatoes, French string beans and Kalamata olives. Their thick slices of toast topped with cremini mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, toasted walnuts and herbs de Provence are destined to become a signature item."
"Avena","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.avenarestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","For a modern take on Northern Italian cooking, Chef Roberto Deiaco, of East 12th Osteria and Armani Ristorante fame, is back with Avena. The mood here is fuss-free-a sentiment that's echoed by white and marble décor. But what the atmosphere lacks in flavor, the food makes up for in leaps and bounds. The feast begins with the bread basket and its addictive carta di musica, a tissue-thin flatbread brushed with butter and sprinkled with salt and rosemary to represent musical notes. Those familiar with the chef's talents know that fresh pasta reigns supreme, and the ravioli filled with creamy ricotta and quail egg yolk doesn't disappoint. For the carnivore crowd, Colorado lamb loin with a Castelveltrano olive crust is worthy of a standing ovation."
"Autre Kyo Ya","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.autrekyoya.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If you love the popular Japanese kaiseki house Kyo Ya, then you'll really love this hip sibling, Autre Kyo Ya. The inside of the restaurant is warm and homey, and while it's less sophisticated than the elder, it's a lot more fun. The space is lined with cozy banquettes, a bar, and plenty of nooks for intimate conversation. But the real highlight here is the food, a unique collection of Japanese dishes amped up with French influences and cooking techniques-think pâté de Campagne; a crispy cauliflower with spicy peanut sauce; and Berkshire pork belly Kamadaki rice pot in a garlic-ginger sauce. Other highlights include chilled corn soup, bobbing with tender edamame and laced with leek oil; and the terrific goma tofu ""cocktail"" in a bonito-seaweed broth."
"Aurora","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.aurorabk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A waning sun over the twinkling East River; a chilled glass of Italian white in an ivy-covered garden: these are the details that set your heart in motion at this beloved little neighborhood trattoria. And, that's long before you sink your teeth into their homemade dishes laced with pristine seasonal ingredients. La vita é bella, indeed. Aurora takes Italian cooking back to its rustic roots with simply dressed market greens; impeccably executed pastas; and beautifully seasoned meats and whole fish. A lovely plate of fave e pecorino arrives bursting with fresh fava beans, sharp pecorino, and springy additions like fennel, pea shoots and mint; while a thick tangle of al dente spaghetti is paired with plump shrimp, chili and a touch of mullet roe."
"Atrium DUMBO","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.atriumdumbo.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This industrial bi-level space has a rather iconic setting along the waterfront, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Dark wood dominates the light-filled interior, amid metal accents and walls that sprout greenery to soften the room. The food may have a farm-to-table focus, but a contemporary tilt is clear in everything that emerges from Atrium's bustling open kitchen. Elegant ""baby greens"" arrive as enticingly charred root vegetables over peppery arugula coulis; whereas crisply seared red snapper served over wild rice with dashi-simmered baby turnips, meaty mushrooms, and finished with a rich fumet makes the chef's (Laurent Kalkotour) French heritage abundantly clear. The chocolate-dipped crème fraîche and quark cheesecake is deservedly popular."
"Cata","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.catarestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Blue plaid and jean-clad waiters set the casual tone for Cata, a downtown-cool restaurant with a long bar and glass case displaying the day's seafood. Distressed mirrors, vaulted ceilings, and iron accents fill the dark, cavernous space with a certain broody, old-world vibe. Long communal tables are ideal for groups lingering over small plates and an extensive list of gin-based cocktails. Nibbling should be the strategy here, starting with whole deviled eggs stuffed with tangy-sweet gribiche beneath a single fried oyster. Crispy bite-sized bombas filled with potato, Manchego, and Serrano sit in a nice, mildly spicy tomato sauce. And caramelized torrija with sorbet is likely to be one of the most enjoyable versions of French toast that you've ever had."
"Aureole","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.charliepalmer.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Nestled smack dab in the middle of the melee that constitutes modern-day Times Square, Aureole’s message is clear from the moment you enter its serene glass façade: drop your bags (and perhaps your shoulders) and relax—it’s time to be pampered by a truly exquisite meal in a truly luxurious setting. Up front, you’ll find the Liberty Room, home to a lively bar that’s ideal for an after-work drink or pre-dinner cocktail; and a small collection of handsome, walnut-topped tables comprising a more casual dining area. Toward the back of the restaurant, the formal dining room cuts an impressive, elegant figure with sexy low lighting, crisp white tablecloths, and polished table settings. Dinner might begin with a beautifully composed and luxurious Hudson Valley foie gras and fig terrine presented alongside a glistening gelée of vin cotto and poached figs. Then move on to tender Nova Scotia halibut crisped to perfection, nestled in a mound of crushed minted peas, and dressed tableside with fish fumet. Desserts are equally sumptuous, including the elegantly prepared apple-Cassis semifreddo sporting a dark chocolate base, piped ribbon of whipped cream, and paired with green apple sorbet."
"Casa Pública","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.casapublicabk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This breezy Williamsburg restaurant will transport you to sunny Mexico in a flash. Tucked into a multi-room space boasting floor-to-ceiling windows, an ample bar, and gorgeous imported floor tiles, Casa Pública is like a modern-day hacienda filled with well-crafted small plates and dreamy cocktails. Here, tequila is a food group of its own. Everything on Casa Pública's menu is executed with care, but this kitchen is so talented you should try venturing outside your comfort zone. Aguachile ceviche arrives wildly fresh, chockablock with tender sea scallops, serrano chilies, and crunchy jicama. For dinner, try the carne encebollada, a sizzling platter of Creekstone ribeye topped with sweet, melted ramps, meco chilies, and smoky bone marrow."
"Casa Enríque","One  Star","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.henrinyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Chiapas. Puebla. San Luis Potosí. One can literally taste the regions and cities that Chef Cosme Aguilar’s amazingly complex menu explores—including his own childhood recipes to honor his mother’s memory. A steady stream of hungry diners seek out this rather small, tasteful dining room for friendly yet professional service and soul-warming fare. Aim for the large, fantastic communal table. Start your meal with hearty rajas con crema, combining none-too-spicy poblanos with sweet, fresh corn, Mexican sour cream, and cheese served alongside a stack of fresh and slightly toasty tortillas. This kitchen’s tender chicken enchiladas with mole de Piaxtla may induce swooning, thanks to a sauce that is unexpectedly sweet yet heady with bitter chocolate, raisins, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, chilies, garlic, sesame, and so much more, with incomparable results. It’s the kind of food that thrills palates (and tempts wanton thoughts). Expect the chamorros de borrego al huaxamole to arrive falling off the bone and redolent of epazote, allspice, and pulla chilies. Its fruity-spicy broth is drinkable. Every bit of every spongy and buttery layer of the cow and goat's milk pastel tres leches is absolutely worth the indulgence."
"Casa Mono","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.casamononyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","There’s something reassuring about a kitchen that gets in whole beasts and does its own butchery— you just know it understands the essence of what good cooking is all about and that their creations will be borne out of a love of food, not balance sheets. Here at the small, but perfectly formed Casa Mono, dishes are designed for sharing but are big enough to do so, and there are none of those one-bite-and-it’s-gone plates that blight so many places these days. Nor do they arrive in a stampede at your table. Instead, they are sent out in a sensible and well-paced order for the benefit of the diner rather than the convenience of the kitchen. Having said that, with so many appealing items on the menu, it’s very easy to over-order. The kitchen is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but rest assured that its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are far more sophisticated than they pretend to be. Creamy eggs with uni is a must; caramelized scallops come with a well-balanced green curry; confit goat will make you question why you don't see more of it on other menus; and the spiced lamb sausages really pack a flavor punch. This is food to cure what ails you."
"Casa","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.casarestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Somehow, this warm little Brazilian brasserie has been hiding in plain sight for nearly two decades. The white room's clean décor, votive candles, and jazz music keep it homey yet fashionable enough for the sophisticated downtown locals who regularly seem to populate it. Come here on a wintery night for a downright perfect bowl of canjinha de galinha, a rustic and flavor-packed chicken soup with string beans, leeks, and rice. Order a bowl of tantalizingly spiced pork, oxtail, and lamb merguez stew and find the accoutrements as tasty as the main dish. Expect an array of creamy black beans, orange segments, farofa (crunchy fried cassava), garlicky spinach, and diabolically hot preserved red peppers. Desserts are appealing and very well priced."
"Casa del Chef Bistro","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.casadelchefny.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Heart, passion, and skill-this inviting bistro embodies the spirit of its dedicated owners. Chef Alfonso Zhicay earned his stripes at some of New York's finest, including Blue Hill at Stone Barns; his daughter is the one-woman show behind the personal, warm service. In a cozy room with large glass windows, elegant (and often vegetable-driven) dishes comfort and surprise. The four-course prix-fixe is a remarkable value, perhaps beginning with a mushroom confit tart showcasing meaty strips of portobellos, mushroom purée, and truffle oil. Move on to savory pasta courses like orzo folded with seasonal vegetable ragout, topped with parmesan foam. Chocolate-hued braised short ribs sit among braised savoy cabbage, buttery potatoes, and hits of citrus horseradish."
"Casa Apicii","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.casaapicii.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If in the mood for cocktails, start the evening by heading to the second floor of this townhouse, where Bar Fortuna entices with a categorically amazing selection. Then dinner waits at Casa Apicii-a restaurant run by the who's who of NY's dining scene, with resumes that include Daniel and Lincoln. The main room is loud, but let's just call it ""lively"" since everyone here seems to be enjoying it. An alabaster fireplace, starburst chandeliers, and plush leather seating fashion an ambience so welcoming that it almost lets you forget about those errors in service. The ""mozzarella menu"" is a delicious statement of their dedication to both the house-made and an array of imported cheeses. Other highlights include freshly made strozzapreti in an exceptionally rich tomato-based sauce of octopus, pancetta, and bone marrow."
"Carbone","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.carbonenewyork.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big, bold, and beautiful ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at night under the low lights, lunch is equally admired among brash bankers with big appetites and Valentino-donning divas. That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers—who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair—remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, just as pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight. Desserts like a proper cheesecake set atop a cookie-crumb base and laced with lemon curd is New York in all its old-school glory."
"Cafe Sabarsky","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.kurtgutenbrunner.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This Museum Mile kaffeehaus is so authentic it may as well be set along Vienna's Ringstrasse. Instead, find it in a Beaux Arts mansion-which is also home to Serge Sabarsky and Ronald Lauder's Neue Galerie, replete with 20th century Austrian-and-German art and design. Located across from Central Park, this gorgeous ground-floor den is clad in dark-stained wood with diners seated along a banquette covered in Otto Wagner fabric. Stunning cakes and pastries are displayed on a marble-topped sideboard. But first, order one of Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner's traditional specialties, including the city's best wiener schnitzel or hearty Hungarian beef goulash with creamy, herbed spätzle. When it's time for dessert, try a wedge of the chocolate, almond, and rum Sabarskytorte."
"Cagen","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cagenrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Unless you're only interested in staring into your date's eyes, sit at the elm counter rather than at a table-that way, you'll get to witness the skill and dexterity on display here. Chef Toshio Tomita spent many years at Nobu and the influence of his alma mater is obvious. There are a number of menu options available-from omakase to à la carte-but one sure thing is that sashimi will be a highlight, whether that's the king salmon with chimichurri, or the fluke with crispy chili and garlic. The soba is also good-you may find authentic slurping a little difficult but be sure to mix the sobayu (the water in which the noodles were cooked) with the tsuyu dipping sauce for a flavorsome little drink at the end."
"Café Frida","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cafefrida.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Festive and friendly with happy hour margaritas that flow like the Rio Grande, Café Frida is almost better than it needs to be, considering its high-traffic location across from the Museum of Natural History. Overall, it feels like a rustic and welcoming hacienda. The extensive tequila list complements the relatively economical fare, showcasing traditional moles. Peruse the menu while delving into the guacamole served in a comal with crisp chips and fiery habanero sauce on the side. Don't miss the clear and warming sopa Azteca, a restorative consommé bobbing with chicken, cactus leaf, and abundant vegetables as well as an array of accompaniments. Finally, tlacoyos spread with a creamy fava purée and slow-cooked pork carnitas are <I>muy</I> buenas."
"Café China","One  Star","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cafechinanyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Blink and you’ll miss its inconspicuous façade, but what a shame, for Café China is a little journey into the magnificent pleasures of Sichuan cuisine by way of midtown. Inside find a long, narrow space fitted with seductive portraits of 1930’s Shanghai starlets, bright red chairs, bamboo planters and a dominating marble-and-wood bar. After struggling with their on-again-off-again popularity, this kitchen is back to their A-game, producing Sichuan (and Sichuan-influenced) dishes with aplomb. Their particular strength lies in the elegant and effortless contrast of complex flavors, even when the prep is decidedly simple—as in the delicious steamed eggplant and ginger sautéed duck. Pickled vegetables achieve harmonious balance between sour and fiery notes; while thinly sliced conch pairs perfectly with tingly chili oil. Sichuan pork dumplings arrive in a delicate wrapper and atop a delicious bath of soy and chili oil. But save space to savor the Chungking chicken, alternately tender and crispy, with abundant dried chilies, scallions and sesame seeds. Spicy cumin lamb, fried to gamey perfection and tossed with sesame seeds, chili peppers and cilantro, is yet another smoky feat."
"Café Altro Paradiso","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.altroparadiso.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sommelier Thomas Carter and Chef Ignacio Mattos, aka Team Estela, work their magic again—this time at a chic Italian café that’s warm, welcoming and completely packed. What’s their secret? At Café Altro Paradiso, a buzzing bar and inviting dining room help set the scene; but the real draw is Mattos’ honest, straightforward and delicious Italian cooking. Kick things off with a wildly fresh crudo dressed with olive oil, caper berry slivers, parsley and a squeeze of lemon; or a bright fennel salad with Castelvetrano olives and diced provolone. Homemade lasagnette is delicious, tucked with silky trumpet mushrooms, leeks and parmesan. Chicken Milanese is rustic and ample, accompanied by lemon, Dijon, and a salad of radicchio, farro and pine nuts."
"Café Boulud","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.cafeboulud.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Taking its cue from classic French cuisine, Daniel Boulud’s refined vision of food and beverage at the Surrey hotel is comprised of two spaces: the jewel box known as Bar Pleiades and this elegant, appealingly understated restaurant. Inside, ritzy residents and in-the-know globetrotters dine in a well-groomed, secluded room furnished with plush carpeting, rich wood accents, and mirrored surfaces. Sparkling elements atop beautifully laid tables set off the spot’s conviviality, and gallant, smartly-dressed servers display unwavering competence in their presentation of uniquely constructed and superb tasting compositions. Under the watch of Chef Aaron Bludorn, the kitchen makes culinary decisions that never disappoint. Classically done poulet rôti showcases evenly moist, crispy skinned chicken finished with a fragrant tarragon jus, while the Crescent Farms Pekin duck, cooked to a perfect pink and sprinkled with coarse salt, is served with currant-studded kasha for wonderful depth in flavor and texture. For dessert, intricately layered crêpe cakes are garnished with rhubarb gelée and kissed with ricotta sorbet. Finally, warm and springy madeleines-a house signature-send satisfied diners on their way."
"Bunker","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.bunkernyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Chef Jimmy Tu could cook his killer Vietnamese street food out of a box, and the masses would still line up. But lucky for us, he and partner/brother Jacky Tu have found bigger and better digs to park their beloved Bunker. Tucked into an industrial Bushwick block, this fun and fresh space features colorful cinder block walls, a bamboo wood bar lined with Crayola-bright metal stools, and ample seating for their fans. And oh, is that fandom deserved. Think caramelized wild shrimp with heritage pork and basil; or fragrant grass-fed oxtail stew. Don't miss the bánh xèo either, which is a crispy, turmeric-laced Vietnamese crêpe tucked with heritage bacon and wild prawns, served over crunchy bean sprouts and paired with Thai basil, red lettuce, and mint."
"Buvette","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.buvette.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Charming and proudly French, Buvette serves delicious Gallic plates to a notably svelte set. While carb addicts can barely fit into these wee seats, it's worth the squeeze for Chef Jody Williams' famously rustic cooking. Inside, everything comes alive with jazz and chatter. Instagrammable dishes take their cue from French classics and may feature crusty olive oil-drizzled country bread slathered with fluffy scrambled eggs, salty prosciutto, and nutty parmesan. Then await croissants-fresh, buttery, and flaky-served with sweet fruit preserves for a typically French and very decadent treat. If not up the block at her other spot or across the pond in Paris, you may even find the chef herself holding meetings over a potent, frothy, and flawless cappuccino."
"Bukhara Grill","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bukharany.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","In NYC's ever-expanding realm of Indian dining, Bukhara Grill has stood the test of time with excellence. Glimpse their expert chefs who seem contentedly trapped behind a glass kitchen wall. Featuring a noisy and yuppie set, this tri-level space is decorated (albeit oddly) with clunky wooden booths, closely set tables, and private rooms. Peek into the kitchen for a whiff of tandoori treats and Mughlai specialties. Dahi aloo papri (spicy potatoes and chickpeas tossed in yogurt and tamarind) is a predictably perfect starter. The signature, wickedly creamy dal Bukhara will have you coming back for more (tomorrow). Even if the service may range from sweet to clumsy, hand-crafted breads meant to sop up the likes of sarson ka saag remain a crowning glory."
"Buttermilk Channel","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.buttermilkchannelnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Buttermilk Channel is the sort of joint we'd all like to have at the end of our street. It's warm and relaxed, run with care and attention, offers an appealing menu for all occasions-and has prices that encourage regular attendance. The name may refer to the tidal strait but also evokes feelings of comfort and cheer in a place that's already cute and where the close-set tables and large bar both add to the animated atmosphere. The kitchen seeks out worthy suppliers and with no little skill imbues each dish with that little extra something, be it the cod with Littleneck clams, the fresh linguini with beets or indeed the buttermilk-fried chicken. This care is even evident at weekend brunches on standouts like short rib hash."
"Bricolage","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.bricolage.nyc","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This delicious Vietnamese gem is overseen by the team behind San Francisco's popular Slanted Door. Tucked into a simple, wood-and-exposed-brick space in family-friendly Park Slope, the restaurant's open kitchen bustles with energy as diners huddle together in lively conversation. Bricolage bills itself as a gastropub (and the creative cocktails are certainly fantastic), but make no mistake-this is modern, next-level Vietnamese bar food. Crispy, golden imperial rolls are routinely churned out of the kitchen and arrive stuffed with glass noodles, crunchy cabbage, earthy mushrooms, and minced pork. Then look forward to ""Unshaking Beef,"" laced in a salty-sweet marinade, seared to tender, juicy perfection, and served alongside a peppery watercress salad."
"Boulud Sud","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.bouludsud.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Far from a chichi French affair, Chef Daniel Boulud uses this ode to Mediterranean cuisine to explore all sides of the sea-from Morocco to Italy to Turkey and back again. Packed and lively, the dining room is airy with vaulted ceilings, natural lighting, and long striped banquettes. A semi-open kitchen allows a glimpse into the creation of deftly prepared delicacies. The menu here is light yet dense with bright flavor, from the crudo du jour (perhaps cubes of hamachi with gently braised cauliflower, pignoli, white raisins, and herbs) to a tender octopus salad with Marcona almonds, arugula, and Jerez vinegar. Huge morsels of chicken with couscous, wilted greens, and preserved lemons make a hearty dish, attractively served in a classic tagine vessel."
"Boathouse Central Park","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.thecentralparkboathouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The word ""touristy"" is mostly used pejoratively but there's no denying that sometimes visitors to the city know a good thing when they see one. Loeb Boathouse was built in 1954 and includes an outdoor bar and a restaurant whose glass wall folds away in the summer to give every table a great view of the lake. If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here's where to come. The menu is a mix of American and European classics alongside less successful dishes of a more innovative persuasion. Try the robustly seasoned linguine with Little Neck clams or Scottish salmon with chickpea purée. While brunch and lunch are year-long affairs, dinner is only served during warmer months."
"Blossom","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.blossomnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Unpretentious and welcoming, this is a vegan favorite with spot-on spicing and delicious surprises. The cream-colored interior is dim with dark velvet curtains and votive candles reflected in round mirrors. A thematically appropriate ""living wall"" resides in one corner of the space. The vibe may seem moody come evening, but the staff is always warm and affable. A black-eye pea cake composed with crushed potatoes is pan-fried to render a golden breadcrumb exterior; while a Moroccan tagine bobbing with chickpeas, a host of vegetables including carrots, turnips and zucchini, and topped with crispy tofu strips is all heart and soul. Come dessert, try the hand-churned cashew ice cream or a lemony cheesecake with a mixed berry reduction and coconut-cookie crust."
"Blue Water Grill","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable.

The stately building is a former bank, with century-old architectural details and marble aplenty. The recently updated interior enhances its classic looks with bright colors, brass accents, and perhaps more importantly, a few more inches of elbow room between tables. The menu has also been revamped by the talented Chef Chris Meenan, who has added signatures like the lobster Milanese. But the cooking remains true to its name, showcasing food that leans heavily on seafaring classics with an ample raw bar and sushi counter. Fish is always perfectly handled and often rises well above its accompaniments on the plate. Desserts are skillfully prepared and downright delicious."
"Blue Ribbon Sushi","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Set just below street level and down the block from its eldest sibling, Blue Ribbon Sushi is an inviting spot to watch the masters at work. A sushi bar dominates the space, with colorful sake bottles and premium spirits on display. The low, wood-covered ceilings and polished tables provide an intimate setting, while the counter is a prime perch for a solo diner. The staff may point to Americanized options, but it's best to trust the expert chefs and go with the omakase. The menu divides itself into Taiheiyo (""Pacific"") offerings, like the kohada spotted sardine, or a sweet and briny giant clam; and Taiseiyo (""Atlantic""), perhaps featuring fluke fin or a spicy lobster knuckle. Maki tempts with the karai kaibashire, with spicy minced scallop and smelt roe."
"Blue Hill","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bluehillfarm.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Knowing when to leave something alone, whether you’re a painter, singer or cook, requires confidence in your material and your own ability. Here at Blue Hill, Dan Barber’s kitchen displays its utter trust in the products at hand not only by not interfering with them too much but also giving them space in which their natural flavors can shine. Think Frank Sinatra, but with sweet corn and tomatoes. This intimate, sophisticated restaurant is as popular as ever and the youthful team clearly shares Chef Barber's passion and pride. The “farm to fork” mantra may be something of a cliché these days but this restaurant demonstrates that the startlingly obvious equation of great seasonal ingredients = great food remains the cornerstone of every great restaurant. Here, a majority of ingredients come from Stone Barns Center and the eponymous farm in Massachusetts. Diners decide between a six course “Farmer’s Feast” tasting menu or a four-course “Daily Menu” which offers some choice. Dishes are described in refreshingly terse terms to reflect the relative simplicity of what’s on the plate, whether that’s wreckfish paired with clams, or gnocchi filled with ricotta. This is food that tastes and feels good."
"Blaue Gans","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kurtgutenbrunner.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This unbridled Viennese-style café feels almost smoky and well-worn, but never out of touch. Its walls are papered with vintage movie posters, while banquettes and tables dominate the dining space. Blaue Gans' strong, loyal following (an increasingly rare feat in the city) is comprised of locals engaging in familiar banter at the bar or communal table. Everyone is here for the impressive Austrian cooking, which may unveil a beautiful bibb, pumpkin seed, and shaved radish salad with a light, creamy pumpkin oil dressing. Other classic treasures include pork Jäger schnitzel with mushrooms, bacon, and herbed spätzle; or classic kavalierspitz accompanied by salty creamed spinach and sweet-tart apple horseradish. Delish desserts will have you at hello."
"Blue Ribbon","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Blue Ribbon stays open until the wee hours, serving somewhat simple but particularly memorable food to SoHo's stylish set. Moreover, this unaffectedly warm and very classic bistro boasts zero pretense and deserves all praise that comes its way. Its décor may have stayed the same through the years-think timeless-but those bar seats remain a hot ticket. This ""chef's canteen"" as it is typically hailed is well-tread for masterpieces like fresh shucked oysters; smoked trout salad tossed with sour cream and zippy horseradish; or matzo ball soup-enjoyable, aromatic, and full of root vegetables. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes takes home the gold medal for comfort classics, while banana-walnut bread pudding with caramel sauce is the very essence of decadence."
"Blanca","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.blancanyc.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","If you’re lucky enough to score a seat at Blanca, you’ll first pass through Roberta’s corrugated metal façade, beyond the scent of a wood-burning pizza oven, and buzzing outdoor garden filled with tattooed urbanites and millennials. Because deep within that compound—which first helped elevate seedy Bushwick into a haute foodie ‘hood—lays this gleaming kitchen for serious eaters. Here, products and dishes take inspiration from around the world, while warm, fluid service keeps the mood friendly among the small group. Blanca serves a carefully conceived 20-course tasting menu that promises immense creativity and an artist’s ability to weave an unforgettable experience. This is dinner theater, with all eyes fixed on the open kitchen and its focused, muted chefs quietly tweezing each morsel of food into perfection. Menus aren't presented until the end of the meal, but list dishes like sunflower seed ""milk"" topped with Pink Lady apple cubes and a mouth-coating grating of foie gras, tied together with chili and salt flakes. Fantastic pasta includes thick noodles ""carbonara"" with crisp and tender bits of lamb. Fragrant Makrut lime makes coconut ice and cashew ice cream refreshing and delicious."

The Italian menu is familiar and unpretentious, the kitchen is adept, and ingredients are superb. But, what truly sets it apart is an ability to serve exactly what you crave without seeming trite or predictable. Even the look is a perfectly conjured mix of warm neutrals, with a sleek yet informal Northern Italian style and impeccably timed servers. Start with the traditional antipasto and then proceed to one of the daily specials like veal Milanese or a lavish dish of garganelli with mushrooms and black truffles. When the dessert cart rolls around, expect an array of excellent house-made sweets like pristine berries under whisked-to-order zabaglione."

Attractive and smartly designed, its silk panels, pottery, and striking display of spoons are further enhanced by a flattering lighting scheme. Equally impressive are the menu's myriad small plates, each of them a refreshing take on Korean specialties. Blocks of soft tofu are quickly deep-fried and boldly dressed with gochujang and a ginger-scallion vinaigrette. Poached daikon rings accompanied by bok choy are glazed with a dark and spicy sauce and stacked high for dramatic presentation.

Our most delightful places","http://www.danielnyc.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","The stylish façade, revolving door, sound of clinking glasses—even before you reach the dining room you feel a part of something special. This bastion of contemporary French cooking epitomizes the “special occasion,” but even those with money to burn treat it with respect. Translucent Limoges-tiled chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling dominate the main room. If you’re at one of the raised tables, you get to look down—literally rather than patronizingly—onto your fellow diners through neo-classical arches. Yet thanks to the personable staff, such grandeur never stifles the animated atmosphere. The kitchen is as sophisticated as the setting and reflects an obvious classical education, yet remains free from the tyranny of tradition. Behold the slow-poached sea scallops served with purple potatoes and a burst of parsley vinaigrette. Bluenose grouper is arranged atop cauliflower purée, surrounded by crispy florets, and finished with a mussel-saffron sauce for a presentation that is as theatrical as delicious. For dessert, sample the divine ""Illanka""-a dark chocolate and espelette crémeux with a blackberry-orange blossom sorbet that practically upstages the season's best fruit."
"Bistro SK","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.bistrosk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","In a neighborhood better known for seafood, this charming bistro breaks the mold with hearty plates of French fare. The husband-wife team lures locals into a snug, dimly lit space with marvelous mahogany-hued French onion soup finished with brandy and a sultry mound of Gruyère. Particular attention to the art of service shines through the dining room. A craving for classic Gallic dishes will surely be satisfied by cooking that is more solid than revelatory. Signatures include a tender roulade of chicken breast stuffed with spinach and mushrooms, served alongside French beans and fluffy, buttery mashed potatoes tucked with black olive for a bit of ""wow!"" For a finale, try the pineapple upside-down cake with a grilled ring of fruit and drizzle of caramel."
"Da Franco & Tony Ristorante","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.dafrancoandtony.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There is so much to love here, where sharply dressed servers dish up equal parts warmth, hospitality, and steaming bowls of scrumptious pasta. The menu leans heavily towards that nostalgic sort of red-sauce, Italian-American cooking that is again finding more and more respect, thanks to mouthwatering dishes like merluzzo marechiaro and veal scaloppini. The interior is lovely, which is particularly important since you're in for a bit of a wait (everything is made fresh to order). But who could complain when tender knobs of potato gnocchi arrive tossed in basil pesto with plush gorgonzola cheese and walnuts. Their chicken scarpariello is perfectly caramelized, deeply flavored, and bathed in a sinfully rich wine broth, fragrant with rosemary."
"Cut by Wolfgang Puck","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.wolfgangpuck.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Wolfgang Puck shot to fame after opening L.A.'s Spago in 1982, and it wasn't long before he reached megabrand status. CUT by Wolfgang Puck is by far his most expansive venture, with six outposts spanning the globe. This Manhattan locale is tucked at the base of the swanky downtown Four Seasons Hotel, and sports a fittingly elegant look with deep magenta chairs, floor-to-ceiling marigold draperies and lovely artwork from the chef's private collection. Kick things off with Puck's signature tuna tartare studded with ginger, avocado, and shallots, then brought to elegant new heights with wasabi aïoli, more avocado, and togarashi crisps. Wagyu arrives charred to caramelized perfection, sporting a gorgeous rosy medium-rare center and graced by béarnaise."

The room still bustles most nights of the week with stylish types who appreciate the triple threat of cozy décor, elegant fare and a crackerjack service team. As the name suggests, guests ""craft"" a meal from seasonal, perfectly executed dishes featuring pristine ingredients. Dinner might kick off with a cured slice of crudo, served with shaved fennel, radish and micro greens in a Meyer lemon dressing. Don't leave without trying one of Chef Colicchio's legendary pastas, like a gorgeous tangle of capellini with lemon zest, grated cheese, ramps and Calabrian chilies."
"Cookshop","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cookshopny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's a delight just to enter this beautiful neighborhood mainstay, with its airy, impeccably clean, and sunlight-flooded dining room. The plant-filled space is furnished with ethically-sourced American oak tables as well as a wall of banquettes; and the bar is perfect for solo dining. And all this charm awaits you even before you sink your teeth into Cookshop's ultra-delicious food. Chef de Cuisine Andrew Corrigan's contemporary, product-driven, and Mediterranean-inspired menu focuses on local sourcing, and includes dishes like ricotta gnudi with brown butter-apple sauce; grain salad with sesame, pomegranate and poached egg; or grilled bigeye tuna with dried fig anchoiade. Breakfast is served during the week, while weekends offer a full brunch menu."
"Congee Village","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.congeevillagerestaurants.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","From the edge of Chinatown comes Congee Village, with its neon-etched sign that shines bright at night. Coveted for its fantastic cooking (check the front window for a slew of accolades), the menu also has a Cantonese focus. Service is basic and the décor kitschy at best, but it's clean, tidy, and tons of fun. This soothing namesake porridge comes in myriad forms- ladled into a clay pot with bits of crispy roasted duck skin, or mingled with pork liver and white fish to form an intense and rich flavor combination. Pair it with dunkable sticks of puffy deep-fried Chinese crullers for a satisfying contrast in texture. Less adventurous palates may deviate into such solid standards as sautéed short ribs and sweet onions tossed in a smoky black pepper sauce."
"Cote","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cotenyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","This Korean steakhouse is a high-minded tribute to owner Simon Kim’s home country, and its renowned love for great beef. Make your way past a long, dark hallway to arrive at this well-designed, slate-colored room with such elegant touches as brass accents and crystal glasses. However, those still in doubt of the restaurant's forte should head downstairs to the glass-enclosed aging room filled with hanging slabs of luscious meat. Begin with banchan that are categorically untraditional, but nonetheless divine. Then dive into crisp Korean “bacon,” which is even better than it sounds, served as little shards of jerky-like sweet and smoky pork belly topped with pickled jalapeño. A pedestrian-sounding kimchi stew is elevated with sophisticated anchovy consommé, potatoes, and zucchini; and the marbling on their aged ribeye, cut into cubes for tabletop searing, looks like something Michelangelo may have sculpted. Match this with grilled mushrooms and galbi for a true feast. Come summertime, pair those sizzling steaks with cold noodles—bi-bim somyum—mingled with white radishes in a mild chili paste sauce. After hours, locals may carve a slot at their impressive bar for more cocktails and fun.

"Contra","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.contranyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Minimal, industrial, and in harmony with the cool neighborhood, this is the kind of classic downtown spot that draws trendy millennials from afar. Seating is either intimate or cramped, and the music is lively or loud, all depending on your mood. Enthusiastic servers add to the room’s energy. Offering six courses for under $75, their prix-fixe is renowned not just for its ambition and creativity but also as one of the best values in town. While the menu format may be fixed, dishes change frequently to reflect the young chefs’ wide-ranging talents and contemporary flair. The hallmarks of this kitchen are clean flavors and unfussy technique, as in raw shrimp shimmering with brown butter, served with tardivo di Treviso, matcha powder, pink grapefruit, and strips of pickled radish. Then, thin slices of trumpet mushrooms served over a brunoise of Asian pear are accompanied by cilantro and dill in a citrusy lemongrass broth, for perfect balance of flavor and texture. Impressive skill is behind the visual appeal in the fluke fillet, beautifully cooked and set in a creamy pool of almond broth with golden tomato segments. A few doors down, sibling Wildair serves natural wines with signature snacks."
"Community Food & Juice","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.communityrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","As part of Columbia University's sprawl, this address is a godsend for students, faculty, and locals from morning to night. Although it's spacious with plenty of outdoor options, the popular spot doesn't accept reservations-and has the lines to prove it. Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekly blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love. For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots, and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote. Come dinnertime, the fish or steak of the day might reveal pan-seared mahi mahi with roasted cauliflower and black truffle beurre blanc, or grilled strip steak brushed with glistening teriyaki."
"Coarse","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.coarsenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Art and food collide at this charming new West Village restaurant courtesy of the talented duo, Vincent Chirico and Marco Arnold, whose food is teeming with depth, flavor, and ingenuity. These chefs showcase their formidable culinary talent alongside the incredible artwork of Amon Focus and Noëmi Manser. Diners can choose from areas labeled Raw, Garden, Sea, or Land-or just leave it up to the chef, who hand-delivers each plate from the semi-open kitchen into the fun, artsy room. Seafood is a particular strength here, so a night in their capable hands might unveil wildly fresh Long Island fluke with Fuji apple, coriander, and fennel. Also try luscious hamachi, artistically plated with avocado, Fresno chili, and a cool, clear ginger-kissed consommé."
"Clinton St. Baking Company","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.clintonstreetbaking.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Having finally expanded to include the space next door, the comfort level and service of this brunch-focused bijou has greatly improved. And what started as a bakery is now a legend-one that draws a perpetual crowd waiting for ample rewards. A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this kitchen has achieved such success in NY that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Breakfast for dinner is always a treat, especially when golden-brown Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and topped with buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless marriage of sweet and savory. Lighter but still lovely, chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of crunchy fried tortilla strips over hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery, and shredded chicken."
"ChouChou","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.chouchounyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","There are two schools of thought when it comes to menu design: one is the encyclopedic, all-inclusive tome, and then there is ChouChou. This East Village hangout, complete with romantic hanging lanterns, is best described as hyper-focused. In fact, the tightly edited menu is divided into just two categories: tagines and couscous. Choose from six couscous preparations ranging from lamb and chicken to lobster, while four tagines tempt from their iconic conical vessels. Once decided, an array of tangy salads and sides arrive. Lifted tableside, the delightful fragrance contained within these tagines immediately seduces, as the silky lamb and spiced couscous delight in all their classic Mediterranean goodness. Moroccan pastries end meals on a sweet note."
"Ciccio","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.ciccionyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Chef/owner Giacomo Romano defines this brilliant little restaurant as an alimentaria-a place where patrons can find ever-changing temptations day or night. This may mean hearty ribollita for lunch or satisfying pasta for dinner. The sunny space is a former antique store that fashions a raw look through whitewashed brick walls and blonde wood tables. Simple, unpretentious food is the focus here, as seen in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula, and pumpkin seeds-grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette. Fresh pasta is a must, especially the strisce alla Chiantigiana tossed with a reduction of wine, guanciale, and red onions. End with a perfect espresso or rich and oozing molten chocolate cake."
"Chumley's","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://chumleysnewyork.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There's little resembling the Chumley's of old, save the name, door, and framed book jackets of writers who apparently found their muse in a glass here. The famed watering hole, which had to shutter temporarily a decade ago after a chimney collapse, has risen from the proverbial ashes as a serious contender. This is thanks to Chef Victoria Blamey, who spent time at Atera among other top spots honing her considerable skills. Leather banquettes, French-oak tables, and patterned wallpaper are long on looks, but don't get distracted, since it's all about the (really good) food here. The dishes may sound familiar-like steak tartare and lobster rolls-but there's nothing ho-hum about this menu. From start to finish, the well-executed items sing."
"Cho Dang Gol","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.chodanggolnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","For a change of pace in bustling Koreatown, Cho Dang Gol offers the barbecue-weary an opportunity to explore some of this nation's more rustic cooking. Soft tofu is the specialty of the house and for fitting reason (it's downright delicious). But, bubbling casseroles and spicy stews are equally heartwarming. The menu also offers favorites like flaky pajeon, satisfying bibimbap, and marinated meats. A sautéed tofu trio with pork belly is stir fried with glassy sweet potato noodles and kimchi, in an excellent sweet and spicy red pepper sauce. The interior has a simple, homey appeal-its cozy dining room simply decorated with close-knit wood tables. The occasional burst of sound drifting down from the upstairs karaoke bar promises a little post-dinner fun."
"Christos","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.christossteakhouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This beloved Astoria steakhouse has a lot going for it, but its cause for celebration is that authentic Greek accent that imbues everything here. Excellent quality beef, as in the signature prime ""wedge"" for two, is dry-aged in-house, charbroiled to exact specification, and finished with sea salt and dried oregano. Vibrant starters and sides underscore the Aegean spirit at play with pan-fried vlahotyri cheese, charred octopus with roasted peppers and red wine dressing, and smoked feta mashed potatoes. Christos has a commanding presence on a quiet tree-shaded corner just off bustling Ditmars Blvd. Mixing shades of brown, the cozy and elegant dining room has a separate bar area and is lined with fish tanks stocked with live lobsters."
"Chez Napoléon","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.cheznapoleon.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Oh-so-popular and family-run by the Brunos since 1982, this atmospheric bistro is not to be missed for its unapologetically creamy and butter-dreamy plates of traditional French cuisine. It's not polite to discuss age, but let's just say that Chef/grandmère, Marguerite Bruno, has steadily commanded this kitchen for an impressive tenure. The scene is magnifique. Take in the creaky wood floors and parchment-colored walls hung with French-themed jigsaw puzzles. Then indulge in chilled silky leeks dressed with the famous house vinaigrette; sautéed veal kidneys in mustard-cream sauce; and steak au poivre with black or green peppercorn sauce. Plan ahead when ordering so you have time (and space) for a classic dessert soufflé sided with crème anglaise."
"Chefs Club","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.chefsclub.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Like a never-ending All-Star game featuring the country's best dishes, the innovative concept behind Chefs Club (by Food & Wine) is a rotating lineup of the magazine's ""Best New Chefs"" honorees over the years. If that isn't exciting enough, the space itself is visually stunning, featuring a state-of-the-art open kitchen with a striking blue-tile backdrop; a sensational modern bar; and lots of loud music to set the mood. Dinner might include a cool, creamy spring pea soup dotted with pickled pearl onions and fresh herbs; or expertly smoked and seared Hudson Valley foie gras paired with sunchoke purée, apple chips, and buttermilk-thyme jam. Squab à la plancha is then glazed with sage-honey and served over grilled confit leeks with a giblet ragout."
"Cherry Point","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.cherrypointnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This charming Greenpoint restaurant used to be a butcher shop, as evidenced by the glass-enclosed meat case built into the end of a lively and very stylish bar. The rustic space now houses a buzzing open kitchen, great music, and jumbo windows that look out over the neighborhood, offering prime people-watching. Most importantly, though, Cherry Point is home to some luscious cooking compliments of Chef Julian Calcott. Speaking of which, tender grilled oysters are laced in an excellent, smoky Hollandaise with roasted and blackened lime. Then crispy and supremely fresh local baby greens are elevated to noteworthy salad status with pristine anchovies. Close out over a nightly pork chop special, rubbed with koji and accompanied by chimichurri."
"Cheburechnaya","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.cheburechnaya1.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This may be a kosher spot with no bagel in sight, but one look at its counter loaded with layers of bowl-shaped noni toki bread and you quickly realize that a meal here is a dining adventure. Specializing in Bukharian (Central Asian) cuisine, longstanding Cheburechnaya has been a neighborhood pioneer. The focused menu is more engrossing than the décor, and it's easy to want every cumin- and paprika-laced item on it. Bring your own vodka and start with the house specialty, chebureki, an empanada-like deep-fried wrap stuffed with either hand-cut lamb seasoned with cumin, chili, cilantro, and paprika; or fennel-sparked cabbage. It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs."
"Chavela's","","Under 25 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.chavelasnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Look for the light blue dome and wrought-iron doors to enter Chavela's and discover an absolute riot of color inside. From the bar's Mexican tiles to the wall of ceramic butterflies, this room is an explosion of artistic sensibilities. Mexico City native, Chef Arturo Leonar, is the man behind this menu and his guacamole-traditional or creative with smoked trout, pico de gallo, and morita chile salsa-is just as pleasing as the setting. Crisp taquitos de cangrego filled with the perfect balance of sweet crabmeat, salsa verde, and crema Mexicana are irresistible; while a thick, deliciously tender pork short rib stew named costilla en salsa verde is studded with nopales and served with a mountain of yellow rice and refried black beans for a wonderful finale."
"Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare","Three  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.brooklynfare.com","Three Stars • Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey","Like a wild mushroom after spring rain, Chef César Ramirez's new home for his incomparable Chef’s Table has sprung up in Hell’s Kitchen, seemingly overnight. As with the original, the interior is furnished with a long dining counter positioned before the stainless steel and polished copper kitchen to keep the mood celebratory and everyone’s eyes on the cooking. Several tables with banquette seating expand on the former location’s comfort and capacity, thereby adding a bit of formality to the otherwise cutting-edge space. Chef Ramirez may be a visionary, but he refrains from being showy by keeping simplicity and astounding precision at the heart of each dish. The result is a cuisine that is visually arresting, a mosaic of both flavors and textures that coaxes only the best from each morsel of fish. This begins with a tartlet generously filled with sour cream and a precariously balanced mountain of glistening trout roe. Scottish langoustines appear raw, but are in fact warmed just enough to retain their tenderness, finished with translucent radish and a bright blossom. Koshihikari rice gently stirred with foie gras and abalone is enriched by a sea urchin emulsion for a luscious denouement."
"Ceetay","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.ceetay.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Its location near Hunts Point and the burgeoning South Bronx art community may have put it on the foodie trail, but Ceetay has become known for inventive Asian cooking at its best. The open kitchen offers diners a view of the race among cooks cutting, washing, and packing up an endless number of takeout orders. The tiny dining room features Mason jar fixtures, a handcrafted bar, and a wall papered with yellowing Asian newspapers. Creative specials include a seared square of sesame-studded rice ""bruschetta"" topped with avocado purée, tuna tartare, and frizzled onions. But, don't miss such high-flying maki as the Kawasaki roll with a mishmash of crab, scallion, sweet glaze, and more. Traditional sushi here stands equally strong, with very nice maguro, ebi, and uni."

You'll be greeted by a blast of music upon entry, where a long bar leads to a brick-lined dining space with leather seats. From there, things just take off: along with a clever menu, upbeat service, and a thoughtful wine list brimming with interesting old-world selections, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy's renowned pastas hit your plate. Think rigatoni with fennel-roasted suckling pig; or spaghetti alla carbonara formed into a ball and topped with buttery spring onions, smoked bacon, and a bright yellow duck egg. Baby sib Pasquale Jones offers similar modern-Italian cuisine with an emphasis on Neapolitan wood-fired pizzas."
"Caviar Russe","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.caviarrusse.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","No playful pun, no name-check for grandma, no oblique reference to a geographical landmark—whoever christened this restaurant clearly wanted to attract a certain type of customer. This is not the place where you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu—that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Osetra caviar you’ve just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi, or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you’ll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths. The only thing missing is James Bond’s nemesis drumming his fingers on the table in the corner. For more plush fun in the sun, there is a seriously posh outpost at The Four Seasons Tower in Miami."
"Enoteca Maria","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.enotecamaria.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","No need to venture far on Staten Island for excellent Italian. Enoteca Maria is just blocks from the St. George Terminal and brought to you by Jody Scaravella, whose cookbook Nonna's House has been earning him (and this tiny gem) much applause. With its Carrara marble and lively vibe, most foodies flock here for a certain authenticity that is rarely sacrificed. Each night, the menu changes depending on which nonna is presiding over the kitchen, as in Nina from Belarus, who might serve a salat Odessa mingling grilled eggplant, red onion, tomato and parsley. Lasagna de Adelina arrives as an inspired layering of zucchini, basil pesto and cream cheese, all topped with parmesan. And for a bit of sweet, try the torta di vaniglia di Melissa served with whipped cream."
"EN Japanese Brasserie","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.enjb.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","EN doesn't pander to the spicy tuna-loving set, but effectively pays homage to highly seasonal Japanese cooking. In such simple and delicate food, flawless execution is a must so don't hesitate to ask for a recommendation. Also on offer are three, exceptionally priced kaiseki menus. The informed staff is happy to offer their opinion on items, be it chilled soba with a warm dipping sauce; aburi Tasmanian sea trout in an enticingly flavored pool of garlic and soy sauce; or iwashi rice coupled with crunchy sunomono and floating in a briny bonito broth. Sweet corn kernels are enrobed in nori for a delightful bit of bite. Lofty ceilings, large windows, and a glass wall lined with shelves of sake attract a young, professional, and fashionable crowd."

The menu bears the chef's signature creative flair, offering a range of small bites, tacos, and shareable large plates. Sample their clever spins on salsa, like a wickedly good smoky cashew salsa that arrives with a sampler salsa starter; or irresistible lamb sweetbread tacos with a flutter of white onion and bright cilantro. Stupak is also a serious pastry chef and it shows in the otherworldly desserts, like the ""avocado."""

Beloved by the local Puerto Rican community, as well as a wave of newcomers, the front room is minimally adorned and filled with lines of to-go orders. Snag a seat in the back- where bright walls are flooded with photos-for friendly table service. Begin with morcilla, a thick blood sausage with chili peppers, cilantro, and garlic before moving on to succulent pernil, pork shoulder, roasted to a luxuriously crisp exterior. Speaking of which, some 30 pigs are delivered here each week and during the holidays, you can also get an entire cooked pig to go. Close out with such complex sopas as cow's feet with yucca or asopado de carmarones."

A bustling bar greets you upon entry; behind that lies a sweet little dining space with large windows, mismatched chairs, and a huge woven mural. Service is engaging and attentive. The food may hit the table swiftly, but nonetheless, the multiple courses are very well paced. This kitchen has a talent for frying to perfection, but the highlight of the menu is arguably their lineup of warm, crusty bocadillos (sandwiches). The menu offers a full range of Spanish tapas that include regional touches from areas like Andalusia, Asturias or Menorca-and clever combinations like the garlic shrimp with ginger and jalapeño or delicious shrimp po' boy."

The rustic tables bustle with young families from the neighborhood. The menu is concise, creative, and often curious in the best possible way. Try Asian small plates like sticky-spicy Korean-style wings, tender Szechuan pork ribs, and comfort classics like grass-fed, dry-aged burgers. Lip-smacking pizzas are categorized as The Reds, Pinks (vodka sauce), Whites (sauce-free), and Greens (tomatillo sauce)."
"Eleven Madison Park","Three  Stars","Over 75 USD","Top class comfortable","http://www.elevenmadisonpark.com","Three Stars • Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey","Chef Daniel Humm’s cooking is clever, innovative and even a little whimsical; it is as often robust as it is delicate. This variety and depth is what sets him apart from other chefs, and puts Eleven Madison Park on the vanguard of America’s dining evolution. No menu is presented here, but diners are empowered to choose their preferences for a number of courses. The myriad plates that subsequently appear are dramatic, like the gueridon presentation of asparagus in rosemary broth cooked sous-vide in a pig’s bladder, but also display extraordinary understanding of technique, as in the dry-aged duck. The latter sports a crisped auburn skin flecked with roughly crushed spices. Baked Alaska for two is a splashy presentation, drizzled with Chartreuse and flambéed tableside. The restaurant is housed within the sort of grandeur that could only ever have belonged to a financial institution. At two decades in, this imposing arena now flaunts an updated interior that befits the luxurious cuisine. Considerable help comes courtesy of the engaging staff as they explain each dish in loving terms but without ever sounding too virtuous. They also know when to talk and when to leave you to enjoying your meal."

The bountiful menu offers favorites like taco trays and nachos in three varieties, as well as a rotating menu of daily specials (be sure to try the fish of the day). Fill up on aguachile de camaron, deliciously classic shrimp ceviche in lime juice and jalapeño; or tender, falling-off-the-bone baby-back ribs served with tequila-chili guajillo salsa, cabbage slaw, and braised camote. Margaritas are a must, but of course."
"Edi & The Wolf","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.ediandthewolf.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This is as much an Austrian heuriger (wine tavern) that one can find in New York. While the menu has some modern and creative elements, the décor is comprised of wood planks and thick coils of rope for an attractively barn-like feel. That cozy and disheveled character makes you forget where you are-same goes for the superb list of German and Austrian wines. On warm days, head to the equally pleasing and tiny back patio. Most everyone knows to go for the schnitzel, served with potato salad, cucumbers, and lingonberries. Still, you won't go wrong with a host of rustic small plates like crisped Brussels sprouts tossed in pork ragout with scallions and pickled mustard seeds, or perhaps roasted beets with pickled walnuts, walnut milk, and dill."

Over in the kitchen, the chefs slide effortlessly between Andalusia, Catalonia, and Castilla-La Mancha, giving each of their dishes a dusting of contemporary flair. Warm goat cheese croquetas are served with apple compote; while shaved summer squash straddles sweet-salty perfection with jamon Ibérico, blueberries, and padrón pepper vinaigrette.

The star of the show are the fantastic buttermilk biscuits, fresh-baked beauties that are split and smothered with pork sausage-studded sawmill gravy. These may then be stacked with country ham, house-made fig jam, and Vermont cheddar cheese; or simply accompanied by molasses, honey, or jelly. A plump fried oyster sandwich appears laced with a mustard-pickled okra remoulade. Much of the produce is sourced locally-a good part of it provided by Goatfell Farm (located on the northern edge of the Catskills mountain range)."
"Dovetail","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.dovetailnyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","The name is apposite because this is one of those restaurants where all the elements fit together and complement each other perfectly, from the look of the room to the style of food and the tone of the service. This large space has a chic and sophisticated feel, with pillars breaking it up into more manageable sections to ensure greater intimacy. The service is also just right: professional and structured yet undertaken with considerable warmth—you really feel as though you’re being well looked after here. What sets this restaurant apart is that vegetables are given their own moment in the limelight rather than merely playing second fiddle to meat or fish. The ingredients are from the top drawer and the dishes are quite elaborate in design but pleasingly easy to eat. Fluke crudo comes at the perfect temperature so that maximum flavor is revealed; cauliflower velouté has a remarkable depth of flavor; and the sirloin and short rib reveal a kitchen strong on technique as well as an understanding of textures and balance of flavors. It would seem churlish to end with anything other than their excellent chocolate soufflé."
"Dumpling Galaxy","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.dumplinggalaxy.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Neon bounces off all the shiny surfaces at Dumpling Galaxy, inside the Arcadia Mall. Navigate beyond the phone retailers and stalls to find this huge, modern space full of red booths and hanging red lights. Spiffy and inviting, this establishment is lauded for crafting scores of dumpling variations, plus comforting entrées that shouldn't be ignored. Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more."
"Donostia","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.donostianyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","You'll want to bring friends and graze your way through these Basque delights oh-so-slowly. Offering traditional tapas and pintxos, the menu at Donostia features small plates like delicate, cold water-brined boquerón, drizzled with grapeseed oil and vinegar; or tender razor clams, laced with white bean purée, piment d'Espelette and lemon zest. The traditional tortilla with thinly sliced potatoes and mayonnaise is yet another big hit. The minute you walk through the door, the dining room feels abuzz with excitement. A narrow row of tables tucked under the antique map of ""Donostia"" welcomes groups. Lone diners can snag a small perch facing Tompkins Square Park for people-watching, while others may head to the back to see dishes being plated as they eat."
"Donguri","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.donguriny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This cozy Yorkville hideaway has endured years of non-stop construction along Second Avenue and a more recent change in ownership and chef. Yet Donguri still perseveres as a highly recommendable venue. Service has lightened up of late, reflected in the genuine smiles of the small and gracious crew, but the cuisine's ethos remains very much unaltered. Don't expect to dine on sushi here-there's more to Japanese cuisine after all, as evidenced by their home-style cooked dishes. Nightly specials posted on the wall direct your attention to options like fried soft-shell crabs so pleasingly crispy and plump they don't need anything else. Okay, a squeeze of lemon if you must. Rice bowls topped with the likes of yellowtail and scallion are yet another specialty."
"Don's Bogam","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.donsbogam.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","At Don's Bogam, the food is fantastic and service indulgent. So, reserve ahead as every seat is filled-from the festive bar up front right down to those two-tops sporting blazing grills. Make no mistake: this is no average K-town joint. Inside, a top-notch venting system lets diners enjoy a smoke-free evening of exceptional grilled meats. Start with fried pork mandu, which are crisp, on-point and extra divine. Wonderfully flaky buchu gochu pajeon is studded with chives for perfect flavor; while pork belly marinated in red wine is smoky and supremely tender. For the ultimate payoff, opt for the memorable beef platter. It features thinly sliced macun and yangnyeom galbi set beside king trumpet mushrooms that are meaty and mouthwatering in their own right."
"Don Antonio by Starita","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.donantoniopizza.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Don Antonio's knows its way around a pie. The namesake outpost, located in Naples, has been running strong since 1901. And if that isn't enough street cred to send you running to Antonio Starita and Roberto Caporuscio's beloved pizzeria, then perhaps the generous buzz surrounding Caporuscio's other New York venture, Kesté, will do the trick. Don Antonio's signature pie is the Montanara Starita-a lightly fried pizza laced with fresh house-made tomato sauce, smoked mozzarella and basil, then finished in the wood-fired oven. Oh, but who could stop there with treasures like the salsiccia e friarielli pizza to sample. This beauty arrives with sweet, crumbled fennel sausage, smoked mozzarella, bitter rapini greens and a glossy swirl of EVOO."
"Dirt Candy","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.dirtcandynyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","East Village foodies and health nuts can't seem to get enough of this culinarily nourishing vegetarian temple. Chef Amanda Cohen and team have comfortably settled into their bigger and bolder digs, where industrial elements meld with white walls and the chic bar proffers both cocktails and consolation seating. Sound too good to be true? It isn't. Dirt Candy's menu is best described as a bounty of creativity, with options like ""Fennel,"" a hearty salad of raw and pickled shavings with black bean cake and caramelized yogurt spread carta di musica; as well as ""Carrots,"" the orange veggies roasted with jerk spices and served over a carrot waffle with peanut mole sauce. Desserts are every bit as inspired, like a chocolate tart peppered with caramelized onions."
"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.dinosaurbarbque.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Huge, loud, and perpetually packed, this way west Harlem barbecue hall draws crowds from near and far. The bar area is rollicking, and for that reason kept separate from the dining quarters. There, wood beams and slats, swirling ceiling fans, and oxblood leather booths fashion a comfortable-and quieter-setting. The scent of wood smoke wafting through the red brick structure (which coincidentally once served as a meatpacking warehouse) only heightens the diners' carnivorous cravings. Minimize decision making and order the Extreme Sampler: a heaping feast of apple cider-brined smoked chicken, dry-rubbed slow-smoked pork ribs, and lean Creekstone Farms brisket. Add on a creative side or two-perhaps the barbecue fried rice studded with bits of pulled pork?"
"DOMODOMO","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.domodomonyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Situated just below street level, DOMODOMO is sleek and lovely, with carefully constructed wood furnishings and a long, smooth blonde wood counter. The buzz at the bar is magnetizing, and service is stellar with each sitting, as diners are presented with a small bowl of water and cleansing hand towel. Sushi is plentiful in New York, of course, but this kitchen ups the ante of their hand rolls with top-notch nori, rice, and fish. The cutting techniques are just as flawless, and while some combinations are familiar and others quirky and inspired, each roll is filled with an array of pristine ingredients. Highlights include spicy salmon with grilled tomato; finely chopped tuna with wasabi; and light, perfectly crisp shrimp tempura with mango salsa."
"dinnertable","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.dinnertable.nyc","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Tucked behind The Garret East, this 20-seat gem is nothing if not incognito. But upon discovery, enter to find a polished bar with silver banquettes and mosaic surfaces. Then make way through the packed room to arrive at speakeasy-like dinnertable-a wee space furnished with just a few seats and that ubiquitous counter. The talented kitchen behind this concept has created a menu of surprisingly elegant small plates. An uni paella ball is seared to crisp delight, while bluefin and avocado are paired with yuzu for a perfect contrast in taste and texture. Then charred striped bass joins together with roasted cabbage, broccoli, and a lemon oil. Stick with this kitchen's Asian influences and close out with a matcha sundae drizzled with miso-caramel sauce."
"Denizen","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.denizenbrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Exceptionally good, next-level cheese is the star of this Williamsburg gem, whether it's a spruce-wrapped Harbison from Jasper Hill in Vermont, or French goat milk blue from La Ferme de La Tremblaye. But the menu doesn't stop at fromage-and Denizen's sophisticated small plates are delicious enough to merit a proper dinner. French onion toast is topped with braised oxtail ragout and soft ribbons of Timberdoodle; butter-poached tile fish bobs in a 'nduja broth over braised sunchokes and cabbage; and burrata plated with broccoli pesto, white anchovies, and sunflower oil is served with crisp rye toast. The modern, tavern-like space is small, so you can expect a wait-but that's not necessarily a bad thing with such an impressive wine list to peruse."
"Del Posto","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Top class comfortable","http://www.delposto.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Most dishes from Executive Chef Melissa Rodriguez at the uniquely opulent and fashionable Del Posto are gorgeously crafted, but it is her playful interpretation of Italian cuisine that makes this kitchen creative. Of course, with neighbors like the High Line, Whitney Museum and Chelsea Market, not only is its location most desirable, but a sense of luxury is clear in their beautifully dressed tables, polished marble, and silk-draped windows. Balconies sit above the striking bar with live piano music pouring through the room. Despite the formality, there is a warm buzz among diners as the impressive suited staff attends to them. The arrival of a refreshed menu still highlights canapés and top-notch classics like vitello tonnato, but indulge in such updated creations as a warm fennel and radicchio salad tossed with balsamic and raisins. Next-level pastas like farfalle with roasted beets and smoked ricotta reflect influences from up north. Then gnocchi studded with halibut and finished with caviar is an all-round delight, as is the highly enjoyable chocolate budino with coconut sorbet. A worthy exception to the all-Italian wine list is a superb offering of some 300 champagnes."
"Delaware and Hudson","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.delawareandhudson.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Chef Patti Jackson can almost always be found in her kitchen—and that’s the first sign you’re in for a treat at this <I>bijou</I> of a restaurant, where her exceptional Mid-Atlantic fare is the name of the game. This kitchen boasts deep ties to some of the tri-state area’s most beloved farms, orchards, and fisheries, adding quality and authenticity to every dish. The prix-fixe menu offers diners a handful of appetizers to share, including Jackson’s famous pretzel roll, followed by a first course and entrée. The starting lineup might feature creamy chestnut soup; golden crab cake paired with purslane and Hollandaise; or green tomato pie with molasses and brown sugar. Pillowy farmer’s cheese dumplings tossed with apple schnitz, ham, and Brussels sprouts could be next. And to follow, a fragrant porchetta paired with cider-braised root vegetables and spinach. Dessert, always a delicious affair, is usually hand-delivered by Jackson herself. The space is small and polished, with flowers sitting pretty on the tables and vivid photographs brightening steely sea-foam walls. If a relaxed, abbreviated tour of the menu is more your speed, head next door to the Tavern for impressive à la carte options."
"De Mole","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.demolenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If the words sweet, competent, clean, and authentic come to mind, you're most likely thinking of this heart-warming haunt for delightful Mexican. Albeit a tad small, with a second dining room in the back, rest assured that De Mole's flavors are mighty, both in their staples (burritos and tacos) and unique specials-seitan fajitas anyone? This delightful pearl rests on a corner of low-rise buildings where Woodside meets Sunnyside, yet far from the disharmony of Queens Boulevard. Fans gather here for hearty enchiladas verdes con pollo, corn tortillas smeared with tomatillo sauce and queso blanco. Crispy chicken taquitos are topped with rich sour cream; steamed corn tamales are surprisingly light but filled with flavor; and the namesake mole is a must."
"Gladys","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.gladysnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Ready to live the Caribbean dream? All it takes is a few sips of a rum cocktail at Chef/owner Michael Jacober's festive café. This turquoise-tinted destination is where locals come together for Happy Hour libations (the comprehensive list features bottles from Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados) as well as for flavor-packed dishes at budget prices. The kitchen is liberal with Jamaica's signature jerk seasoning, a magical blend of allspice, Scotch bonnet pepper, and citrus that's applied to chicken, pork, seitan, and even whole lobsters. The latter are kept fresh in a tank and a thrown onto a pimento wood-fired grill. Save room for the succulent bowl of curry goat with chunks of potatoes and carrots, best enjoyed with a side of coconut-scented rice and peas."
"Golden Unicorn","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.goldenunicornrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This age-old dim sum parlor, spread over many floors in an office building, is one of the few Cantonese spots that actually has the space and volume to necessitate its parade of steaming carts brimming with treats. While Golden Unicorn's system is very efficient and part of the spectacle, arrive early to nab a seat by the kitchen for better variety and hotter items. A helpful brigade of suited men and women roam the space to offer the likes of exquisitely soft roast pork buns, or congee with preserved egg and shredded pork. Buzzing with locals and visitors, it is also a favorite among families who appreciate the kid-friendly scene as much as the delectable, steamed pea shoot and shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai, and rice rolls stuffed with shrimp."
"Glasserie","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.glasserienyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Housed in an old glass factory, the beautiful Glasserie is colorful, rustic and industrial, with lots of original details, a welcoming bar, and a small door that peeks into the bustling kitchen. Add to this lovely setting a straight-up delicious Middle Eastern menu from a wildly talented kitchen, and you begin to understand why the crowds are flocking to this hot spot. Manning the kitchen is Eldad Shem Tov, a talented chef who favors organic and locally sourced ingredients. Highlights may include the table-shared mezze feast-served with ten or so incredible small dishes-or the rabbit taco, spiked with harissa and folded into a thin kohlrabi ""taco"" with herbs and radish. The silky chicken liver mousse, served with arak, is a crowd-pleaser and fittingly so."
"Gloria","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.gloria-nyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Though dinner at Gloria doesn’t come with a side of personal space (read: you’ll likely be elbow-to-elbow with your neighbors as you dine), the tiny spot slays its Ninth Avenue competition with a trendy ambience, buzzing bar, and terrific food crafted by Chef Diego Garcia. The concise, seafood-centric menu, which offers just a handful of savory items and two desserts, reflects the chef's impressive background. Expertly charred octopus or red snapper served in a red wine béarnaise-inspired sauce both hint at Garcia's time at Le Bernardin, while a tres leches cake filled with thick cream is a nod to his Mexican heritage. No matter what you order, be sure to arrive with a fully-charged phone, as these dishes practically beg to be shared on Instagram."
"Giuliana's","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.giulianassi.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Staten Island may swarm with Italian-American eateries, but this festive classic does a masterful job in keeping its kitchen distinct and the patrons loyal. Guiliana's is the queen bee amid shops, catering halls, and ample competition. The interior is modest and charming, with framed pictures of smiling patrons and a fully stocked bar. Hearty stracciatella is loaded with spinach and a comforting sauce of eggy parmesan, finished with a generous shower of black pepper. Seek out the perciatelle con sarde, a Sicilian-style pasta tossed in a powerful blend of fennel, saffron, raisins, sardines, anchovy paste, and a crunch of toasted breadcrumbs. A trio of gelatos-pistachio, chocolate, and bitter almond, served with biscotti-is a divine ending."
"Gigino at Wagner Park","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.gigino-wagnerpark.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","To find food this tasty in a rather touristy neck of the woods is a welcome surprise. A setting that boasts views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Hudson River is unique enough that they could probably get away with less than this very good Italian-ish food. In warmer months, the best seats are out on the patio amid blinking harbor lights and a gorgeous vista. A tastefully subdued dining room and unpretentious service make it a pleasant place to while away an evening. This is a kitchen that cuts no corners, especially in the superb potato gnocchi coated in a silky tomato ragù with braised meatballs. Melanzane alla Sorrentina features layers of mozzarella, basil, chunky tomato sauce, and thick slices of fried eggplant."
"Gennaro","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.gennaronyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Despite its age, Gennaro hasn't lost its good looks or popularity-it still packs in hungry locals nightly who aren't deterred by its borderline gritty surrounds or no-reservations policy. Come early or risk waiting, which isn't so bad considering their bar, whose by-the-glass offerings are vast and very appealing with both familiar and unusual Italian choices. The menu can be overwhelming considering its long list of pastas and daily specials, so trust your gut and you can't go wrong. Start with the polenta, served almost quattro stagione-style, with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and sliced portobellos; before twirling your taste buds around chewy bucatini showered with pecorino and pepper. The tiramisu is a light, creamy, and fluffy slam dunk."

Founded by Dean & Deluca's Giorgio Deluca, the stylish and distinctly Italian L-shaped room focuses on straightforward pizza, outstanding pastas, and serious desserts. You can't go wrong with the handful of pastas on the menu, such as the lovingly crafted pouches of spinach and ricotta ravioli in a light tomato sauce. Delicately grilled lamb chops with peperonata and rosemary-roasted new potatoes are simple yet beguiling. Try one (or two) noteworthy desserts, including the flaky crostata filled with rich chocolate ganache and bright green pistacchio di Bronte."
"Gelso and Grand","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.gelsoandgrand.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It may be located smack in the middle of tourist-trappy Little Italy, but Gelso & Grand is a special place for creative and contemporary Italian food. The space is attractively industrial, with small tables and large windows that fling open for prime people-watching in warm weather. It may also be a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but that difference goes straight into the quality local ingredients and skillful cooking. Begin with a pretty fan of tuna carpaccio garnished with tomato jam, candied ginger chips, and buttery green olives. Wood-oven fired pizzas are popular, but don't skip out on house pasta such as the roasted lasagna, layered with breaded eggplant fried golden brown, melted mozzarella, chunky Bolognese, and creamy tomato sauce."
"Gallagher's","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.gallaghersnysteakhouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A multi-million dollar renovation hasn't glossed over any of Gallagher's iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the seasoned stallion's former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu's ""other soup"" is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged. Gallagher's fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory. The rib steak is a bone-in ribeye that arrives mouthwateringly tender with a side of warm and savory house sauce."
"Ganso Ramen","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.gansonyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","A welcome sight amidst the sneaker stores and pizza joints of commercial Fulton Mall, this friendly and comforting ramen-ya is a sure sign that things are changing in downtown Brooklyn.

"Gabriel Kreuther","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.gknyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Proving that the death of fine dining has been grossly exaggerated, Alsace-born Gabriel Kreuther’s eponymous midtown restaurant offers artfully designed surroundings, creative and eye-catching food, and service that is formal and quite ceremonial. It’s certainly a striking room, with columns of reclaimed wood juxtaposed with creamy white leather seating and a glass wall offering glimpses of the impressively calm goings-on in the kitchen. The table settings are immaculate too, with delicate glassware, cups and bowls that you can’t stop stroking, and surgically thin modern cutlery that you’ll either love or hate. The chef's classical culinary upbringing underpins his modern creations and his Alsatian heritage plays a role too. Alongside kugelhopf, you'll also find sauerkraut-it makes an appearance in one of his more theatrical dishes where it's mixed with sturgeon, garnished with caviar and presented at the table with the lifting of a glass cloche filled with applewood smoke. The desserts, if you can get past their somewhat pretentious monikers (""revisited"" or ""ethereal"" anyone?) show that the pastry section is also given license to push boundaries."
"Fumo","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.fumorestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The setting at Fumo is undeniably chic, with bright white walls, light wood tables, and dark leather furnishings.

Pizzas are 12-inches and come rosso or bianco, topped with the likes of vodka sauce, wild mushrooms, or charred vegetables. Excellent pastas, like the penne Caprese, are tossed with tomato sauce, fresh basil, and creamy mozzarella. A neatly deboned, beautifully seasoned branzino arrives subtly flavored with fresh herbs and alongside wilted spinach as well as a lemon wedge."
"Freud","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.freudnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The hospitality is warm and food irresistible at this welcoming spot on LaGuardia Place, flanking NYU's sprawling footprint. Inside, you'll find a décor that's part-rustic part-bistro and the sum is something elegant and familiar. The bar boasts sensational flower arrangements; and the wines by the glass are particularly unique. At Freud, you're meant to linger. The Austrian-German menu is small but gorgeously executed by Eduard Frauneder. Following suit, the kitchen consistently delivers ingredients and dishes that go beyond nostalgia. And though the desserts ring familiar, Frauneder's versions are an absolute must.

Frankies 457 Spuntino, a charming, brick-lined space with bare wood tables and a quiet, shady backyard strung with twinkling bistro lights, is a classic example of their easy Brooklyn style. Seem familiar by now? Well, these guys wrote the book. Service is laid-back and unpretentious, perhaps because they know the food does the talking here: a wildly fresh fennel, celery root, and parsley salad arrives with aged pecorino and a delicate lemon vinaigrette; while a tender tangle of linguini is laced with a fresh tomato broth studded with fava beans and garlic."
"Foragers City Table","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.foragerscitygrocer.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This restaurant-cum-market is an offshoot of an independent grocer in DUMBO, though its kitchen philosophy seems to have arrived via California.

It's staffed and patronized by the sort of local-loving sycophants who consider it an honor to dine here-and it actually is. The kitchen team will impress you with their skilled cooking featuring local produce from the market's own farm in Columbia County. Heirloom tomatoes are whirled into a lush gazpacho; artisanal dried pasta produced in Brooklyn from organic grain is deliciously dressed; and roasted chicken with Hudson Valley corn polenta is comfort food extraordinaire."
"Freek's Mill","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.freeksmill.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This contemporary American small plates restaurant calls an industrial stretch of Gowanus home. Inside, you'll find a cozy, intimate space with exposed brick walls, filament light bulbs, as well as a wood-burning oven in the back of the dining room-it's that Brooklyn feel we've come to know and love, and Freek's Mill does it just so. The cuisine is seasonal, light, and fresh, with each plate delivering something unique and unexpected. Try the fried soft-shell crab-its streak of cashew butter balanced by a sweet and spicy sambal and chopped baby bok choy; or the deliciously caramelized barbecue kohlrabi with buttery grits and wilted mustard greens.

Inside, the setting is routinely packed to the gills, both up front where there is a bar and counter, as well as in the back dining room, adorned with an abundance of maritime-themed artwork. Expect to taste plenty of the namesake bivalve, hailing from Prince Edward Island. Priced by the pound and steamed in no fewer than twenty globally inspired broths, they are best with some killer hand-cut skinny fries. Mussels No. 23 refers to the daily special, which may feature these mollusks in a fragrant bath of white wine, tomatillo salsa, and jalapeño for a bit of heat.

Don't miss the tender shrimp fritters, enveloped by mashed cassava and chilies; fresh papaya salad laced with mint leaves, sweet poached shrimp, and crushed toasted peanuts; or a surprisingly complex and special coconut curry bobbing with sweet kabocha squash, Thai eggplant, and tender carrots."
"F & J Pine Restaurant","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.fjpine.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This Bronx institution began as a simple storefront eatery in 1969. These days, Frankie & Johnnie's Tavern covers an entire city block, with a catering hall to boot. Locals, celebrities, Yankees and their fans alike love to roll in and pull up their sleeves in this large dining room, with its welcoming bar, visible pizza oven, backyard garden, and brass tags listing luminaries like ""Rocco the Jeweler."" The Bastone family has been critical to the Bronx food scene for over 50 years now, and it shows through cooking that is as solid as it gets. No one is reinventing the wheel, but gargantuan portions of beloved Italian-American classics like stuffed pork chops, delicious pizzette, tender stuffed artichokes, and fresh seafood pastas more than hit the spot."
"Estrellita Poblana III","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.estrellitapoblanaiii.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The Arthur Avenue area may be known as the artery of the Little Italy of the Bronx, but a Mexican restaurant shines here with its fluffy tamales loaded with tender, fragrant corn, and so much more. The small interior is brightened with gold walls, a fuchsia ceiling, and three stars set in the coffered ceiling. Exposed brick and a semi-open kitchen complete the comfortable scene. Conversation is common between the pleasant servers and other diners, as searing-hot sopa with shredded chicken and a nest of fideos is placed on an immaculate table. The bistec Estrellita is served with a fiery habanero sauce, topped with pico de gallo, and flanked by a side of rice and beans. Flan is a lovely finish-though that generous steak may fulfill even the heartiest appetite."
"Faro","One  Star","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.farobk.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","There is an undeniable air of sophistication here, making Faro much more of a destination than neighborhood stop. The space looks like a cover shoot for an interior design magazine. Every wall, from the painted brick dining room to the back of the open kitchen, is covered in glossy white to complement the metal-framed seating and wood plank floor. The smell of the kitchen’s wood-burning fire perfumes everything here, acting as a savory prelude to the cuisine and reminding guests of their motto: “Earth, Wheat, Fire.” Chef Kevin Adey's worthy exploration of pasta begins with a traditional Southern Italian frascatelli, made with irregular bits of semolina dough mixed with tender peas and shoots dressed in bright mint oil. Offerings go on to include candy-shaped caramelle filled with ricotta, then tossed with bacon, charred ramps, and airy potato cream. From the carte, dry-aged duck breast is cooked to rosy perfection and fanned over green wheat and roasted kabocha squash, with orange squash purée and a drizzle of savory-sweet Thai caramel. Crushed feuilletine add a crunchy note to textbook-perfect golden sable crust filled with chocolate custard and sliced bananas topped with butterscotch syrup."
"Extra Fancy","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.extrafancybklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Williamsburg's restaurant scene may be awash in excellence, yet this guy still manages to find its own niche. Their particular bag is fresh seafood, rendered in an inventive American fashion, and served in a charming, rustic dining room dressed with warm woods and nautical lighting fixtures. Out front, you'll find a lively, packed bar; toward the back, cozy seating and a truly welcoming service staff. Pristine dorade ceviche arrives bursting with crisp onion and bright cilantro; while a lovingly constructed lobster roll teems with sweet, fresh meat. Wild-caught King salmon confit is paired with smoked crème fraîche, dill and toasted bagel crumbs. Don't miss the superb Jonah crab bucatini with tender Littleneck clams, lemon and parsley."
"Estela","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.estelanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This boisterous little hot spot is the perfect place to meet friends for a night of sharing small plates over a good bottle of wine. The talented duo of Chef Ignacio Mattos and Co-owner Thomas Carter have mastered exactly how to keep the vibe cozy yet festive and packed with chic crowds. Dimly lit globe lights overhead and small marble tables prevent things from feeling claustrophobic. The bold and creative cooking features dishes like beef and sunchoke tartare, with each morsel of meat and root vegetable cut to the exact same size and faintly glistening with egg yolk and olive oil alongside country bread. An appetizing range of textures underscore the rice in squid ink sauce folded with bits of fried rice and tender squid set over romesco."
"John Brown Smokehouse","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.johnbrownseriousbbq.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Regional barbecue has arrived in the city, but John Brown continues his reign as the true ""bawss"" for Kansas-style bites. The décor is minimal with a front area plating infinite orders, but find a seat in the back and settle in for a serious shindig. Amid sepia-toned photos and a flat-screen showing football (a religion here), find famished city folk ordering perfectly done proteins served with a thick and rich barbecue sauce. Rib tips and burnt ends are juicy, tender, and sumptuous when paired with baked beans studded with bits of smoked meat or killer mac-and-cheese that is appropriately bright orange, creamy, and sparked by black pepper. An order of the corn pudding is a must, and nicely caps off a meal here. Fingerlicking is an inevitable end."
"Jora","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.jorany.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Peruvian pottery and tapestries set a casually elegant scene at this neighborhood gem, which is quickly earning a loyal following for its frothy pisco sours and dishes full of spice and flavor. Beyond the limestone façade, the deep, narrow dining room is filled with light from arched windows and boasts a wall covered in river stones as well as a relaxed bar with striking artwork. The diversity of Peruvian cuisine is on tasty display here, from classic items like ceviche mixto with crunchy red onion, oversized kernels of corn and sweet potato, to chupe de camarones-a thick, restorative soup of rice, seafood, and gently poached eggs. A juicy skirt steak with sautéed onions, peppers, cilantro, and sweet plantains on the side will satisfy carnivores."
"Joe's Place","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.joesplacebronx.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","From abuelas to niños, locals know to come to this ""place"" for solid Puerto Rican food. A glance at the wall of politicos and celebrities who have dined here proves how well-loved it truly is. The space is divided into two very different areas: a classic lunch counter also serving takeout, and a dark wood dining room. A wonderful Nuyerican accent can be heard at gathering family tables and tasted in classic dishes like mofongo al pilon de bistec (savory shredded beef over mashed plantains) or pernil con arroz y gandules (roasted pork with pigeon peas and rice). Prices become even more reasonable when you realize that dishes are big enough to be split three ways. Daily sopas are a highlight, but end meals with a hot and flaky cheese-filled pastelito."
"Jin Ramen","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.jinramen.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","All you really need to know is that this is hands-down the best ramen above 59th Street. Sure, decorative elements are simple, and it hardly matters that this gem is hidden behind the 125th Street station's brick escalator. What comes from the kitchen however deserves kudos. The menu is concise but full of classics like pan-fried gyoza served with an addictive sesame seed-flecked dipping sauce. Shio, shoyu, and miso ramen are all delightful, but the tonkatsu ramen is a special treat. This piping-hot, almost creamy, mouthcoating distillation of pork bones is deliciously rich and stocked with fragrant chasu, pickled bamboo shoots, slivered green onion, and a soft-boiled egg. For added fun, visit Kissaten Jin-an offshot serving homestyle bites and soba made by a master."
"Joe's Shanghai","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Diners at this venerable Flushing institution are greeted with menus and a dish of black vinegar dipping sauce, as it's practically a given that you'll be ordering their famous xiao long bao here. Despite stiff competition, these soup dumplings-soft and delicate with perfectly spiraled shoulders and a mouthful of lip-smacking golden broth wrapped inside-still stand a head above the rest. In fact, these chefs have made it their mission to ensure biting into them is a sensual experience. But there are other pleasures to be had here, too, such as steamed cabbage in light broth scattered with dried shrimp, or the popular Shanghainese lion's head meatballs. Made from ground pork, the latter are incredibly light and lacquered with a dark, savory glaze."
"Jewel Bako","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.jewelbakosushi.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Only a discretely marked door and tiny glass windows signal the entrance to this beloved sushi bijou. Once inside, you’ll find a deeply elegant scene highlighting sloped bamboo slats that frame a row of beautifully plated, close-knit tables. There’s a gorgeous blonde wood sushi bar in the back, while gentle jazz music plays in the background. The overall effect is very appealing and particularly serene. Service is excellent and begins at the door, with the reserved host carefully attending to your belongings. The waiters have an eagle eye for detail, managing to be so unobtrusive that you’re able to enjoy intimate conversation. You can choose from multiple options-pick from a wide variety of fish à la carte or leave it up to the talented chef by going with the fixed-price omakase. Either way, you're in for a culinary treat. The quality and seriousness of the kitchen remains excellent with each passing year, turning out exquisite dishes like seasonal lobster sashimi laced with ponzu-its head and innards later presented in a savory miso soup. The sashimi that follows is equally astounding, from the slicing technique to the fish quality, much of it seasonal and flown in directly from Japan."
"Jean-Georges","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Top class comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","The longevity of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s flagship restaurant can be attributed to a combination of factors—a sumptuous dining room, polished service, a discreet atmosphere, as well as accomplished, contemporary cuisine. Lunch is a superb option for those who don't want to break the bank. However, the best way to experience the talent of the kitchen here is to go for the prix-fixe dinner menu, where you might get a choice of seven or eight compositions per course. Classical French techniques underpin the cooking, although sometimes you’ll come across subtle influences of a more global heritage, including yuzu with creamy sea urchin, or chipotle with shrimp. Desserts are more elaborate constructions and the ingredients come from the luxury end of the counter. Like walking through Business Class on your way to First, you have to pass through the appealingly buzzy Nougatine to get to this restaurant. The low-slung chairs and large tables mean you need a certain confidence in your conversational delivery if you want to entertain your whole table. If you're here on a date, which many appear to be, you could find yourself sitting side-by-side-the new orthodoxy of dining à deux."
"Jake's Steakhouse","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.jakessteakhouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This bustling and upscale restaurant is one of the borough's best steakhouses. Duck inside the limestone facade and you'll find a clubby, multi-level space with lots of private nooks, a lively, well-stocked bar, flat-screens displaying the latest games, and an upstairs wall of windows overlooking Van Cortlandt Park. A true American steakhouse ought to have a substantial shrimp cocktail, and at Jake's this classic starter arrives fresh and plump with the sweetness of the shrimp offset by a tangy cocktail sauce. Any steak on the menu can be topped with Gorgonzola and a thatch of frizzled fried onions, though a succulent and well-marbled T-bone seared to rosy pink perfection begs for little beyond a fork, knife and good conversation."
"James","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.jamesrestaurantny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This romantic restaurant holds a nostalgic sort of charm, as though it's been a fixture on the corner for a hundred years. It hasn't, of course, but its pressed-tin ceilings, silver bowls filled with bright citrus, whitewashed exposed brick walls and tufted leather banquettes lend it an old-school sort of sophistication. Chef/co-owner Bryan Calvert and his co-owner wife, Deborah Williamson, live just above the restaurant, pulling most of the herbs used in the kitchen's dishes straight from their rooftop garden. Items wander from sautéed Carolina shrimp over creamy ""polenta"" to crispy honey-glazed pork belly-all of it divine. The restaurant holds a popular burger night every Monday, with an expanded burger menu and happy hour prices all night."
"Jack the Horse","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.jackthehorse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A Brooklyn Heights favorite, this sleepy American tavern is a consistent spot in a neighborhood that lacks a variety of serious eats. However, exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks set a cozy tone, and have regulars returning for the well-stocked bar, complete with myriad bitters. Slurp a few bivalves at the Oyster Room next door before settling into a table, or if thirst beckons, sip an Old Fashioned with barrel strength Bourbon while perusing the menu. Some locals head straight for the burger-focaccia layered with Gruyère, caramelized Bourbon onions, and a juicy beef patty. Though ricotta and butternut squash ravioli, tossed in sweet brown butter and topped with crumbled smoky bacon, is a fine alternative."
"Italienne","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.italiennenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Two Italians in one: the front room is the more animated and relaxed, with a counter bar and a menu of snacks and sharing plates; in the larger and somewhat rustically decorated dining room at the back you'll find more ambitious cooking and a team of enthusiastic servers. Here Chef/co-owner Jared Sippel's menu is divided into ""Beginnings,"" ""Grains from the field,"" and ""The land and the sea."" The influences are Northern Italian with the occasional foray over the border into France. Start by sharing some of their freshly sliced Prosciutto di San Daniele; homemade pastas, like pappardelle with snail ragout, are a welcome departure from the usual; and mains like rabbit with apricot and speck show that the kitchen knows its way around an animal."
"Ivan Ramen","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.ivanramen.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This delicious little ramen-ya couldn't have landed on a more fitting spot. It may appear rough around the edges, but the ultra-hip 'hood and its affinity for indie rock beats fit Ivan's scene to a tee. Then consider their sweet staff gliding within the snug space filled with packed seats, and realize how serious a treat this is. Solo diners head to the counter for a view of the action-packed kitchen, while others look for a seat from which to admire that mural of manga cutouts. Find them launching into pickled daikon with XO sauce and sesame seeds for a 'lil crunch and whole 'lotta flavor. Displaying a flare for non-traditional ingredients, paitan ramen with tender chicken confit in a chicken-and-kombu broth makes for a singular, savory, and tasty highlight."
"Indian Accent","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.indianaccent.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Nestled inside the posh Le Parker Méridien hotel, Indian Accent offers gorgeously plated food with a decidedly modern spin. An outpost of the highly acclaimed original in Delhi, the New York space is sleek and exotic, with purple banquettes, brass details and a shimmering gold-accent wall. The service is polished and professional, with the knowledgeable staff carefully walking you through a customized prix-fixe menu selected from various parts of the carte. Celebrated chef Manish Mehrotra heads the talented kitchen, serving up impressive starters like freshly griddled phulka paired with jackfruit, green chili sauce, and micro sprouts. Perfectly tender sea bass is then coupled with herbed barley, trout roe, and puddled in creamy coconut sauce."
"Il Gattopardo","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ilgattopardonyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This leopard's take on Italian dining favors elegance over rusticity. Set within two Beaux Arts townhouses (once home to a Rockefeller family member), the restaurant is an understated sprawl of ivory walls contrasted with dark-stained floors and smoky mirrors. The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine. Here, a golden-brown and crisp-skinned baby chicken arrives split into two neat halves, simply grilled with rosemary and lemon, and served with butter roasted potatoes. And like everything else at Il Gattopardo, the cassata Siciliana-with its candied fruit and bright green almond paste-is a dressed-up take on the classic."
"Il Poeta","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ilpoetarestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Queens is teeming with family-owned Italian restaurants dishing up the red sauce, and yet Il Poeta manages to carve out a unique place among its competitors by cooking real classics that locals can't help but enjoy. Perched on a quaint corner of Forest Hills, the fresh décor is simple but elegant, with a suited staff and vibrant pieces of art lining the walls. Chef Mario di Chiara knows a thing-or ten-about Italian fare: you can't miss with items like cannelloni gratinati al profumo di tartufo, a homemade pasta plump with veal and carrot, baked in buttery béchamel, and kissed with truffle oil; or pollo spezzatino alla pizzaiola con salsiccia, a rustic chicken stewed in a light-as-air tomato sauce pocked with sweet porky sausage and roasted peppers."
"Il Cortile","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ilcortile.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Beyond this quaint and charming façade lies one of Little Italy's famed mainstays, ever-popular with dreamy eyed dates seeking the stuff of Billy Joel lyrics. The expansive space does indeed suggest a nostalgic romance, with its series of Mediterranean-themed rooms, though the most celebrated is the pleasant garden atrium (il cortile is Italian for courtyard), with a glass-paneled ceiling and abundant greenery. A skilled line of chefs present a wide array of familiar starters and entrées, from eggplant rollatini to chicken Francese; as well as a range of pastas, such as spaghettini puttanesca or risotto con funghi. Several decades of sharing family recipes and bringing men to one bent knee continues to earn Il Cortile a longtime following."
"Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ilbucovineria.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This is the kind of cooking and scene that makes us all wish we were Italian. Start with a stroll through the alimentari (located up front) to grab some pickled beans and serious cheeses. Then, head towards the rustic dining area in the back, which oozes warmth and comfort. Note the meticulously conceived copper roof, open kitchen, and other decorative accents that set a picturesque backdrop for a delicious meal. The food here is authoritative and tasty, with a nice representation of Italian cooking from breakfast through dinner. The porchetta panino is timeless, amazing and vies to be the finest around. Skillfully crafted pasta includes textbook-perfect bucatini cacio e pepe. Finish with an affogato, topping a scoop of vanilla gelato with hot espresso."
"Il Bacco","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ilbaccoristorante.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","With its striking Mediterranean façade, crimson awnings, and rooftop garden, Il Bacco is hard to miss. This local favorite offers a stylish Little Neck-by-way-of-Tuscany setting for enjoying their thoughtfully crafted classics with top-notch ingredients. A seasoned staff guides patrons through the many menu temptations. The kitchen dutifully honors Italian-American staples with skill. The pizza oven is a beauty, churning out perfect pies, while tables pile up with salads of fennel, red radicchio, pitted olives, and orange, as well as pastas like house-made spinach fettuccine with peas, cream, mushrooms, and parmesan. Portions are generous but do not sacrifice quality, which is clear in the hefty rack of lamb with brandy sauce and simple roasted potatoes."
"I Trulli","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.itrulli.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Although it's steps off Park Avenue South, you'll likely find yourself checking the street signs to confirm you're still in Manhattan as you enter this Italian gem. While beloved I Trulli threatened closure, it thankfully just moved next door and now boasts a polished look (blue walls, marble bar, linen-swathed tables). Rest assured though as the multi-seasonal walled garden will still have you entirely smitten. This family run spot has a long history of doling out elevated comfort food. Few things are as reliable as the pasta handmade by Mamma Dora, who has her own perch in the dining room and puts to shame most other versions around. And thanks to said trullo, deliciously charred pizzas are still offered next door at Sottosuolo, a more casual spinoff."
"Iki","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ikicuisine.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","While One Fulton Square hasn't quite caught on, this upscale gem tucked into the Hyatt Place Hotel is a worthy anchor and addition to the local scene. Duck inside the modern glass façade and you're greeted with curving leather booths and beautiful blonde flooring. You've seen this before, you think to yourself, but this is a curious outlier- think Queens in high heels. Diners can opt for omakase or à la carte. While the former might begin with a chilled bowl of soft tofu topped with creamy uni; the latter showcases cool kanpachi, shima aji, tai, and kinmedai nigiri. Then, tender-cooked rice, cooked in an earthenware pot, is tinted with the addition of dashi, topped with maitakes, and folded with flakes of salmon for a bright assortment."
"I Sodi","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.isodinyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Manhattan has classic Italian and new Italian, but not many thoughtful Italian restaurants. Tuscany native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this ristorante. She consciously selected every aspect of the design, from the linen napkins to the thick, striated glass windows that hide the modern space from the marauding groups of young people on Christopher Street. Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be."
"Hunan House","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hunanhouseflushing.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy."
"Hugo & Sons","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hugoandsons.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Hugo & Sons may contain every requisite detail that conjures the look of rustic Italian hospitality straight from the heart of Park Slope, thanks to exposed brick, penny-tiled floors, and wood planters. Yet this is a special little family-focused place, where the skilled chef/owner, Andrea Taormina, is attentive and hands-on. The simple and uncomplicated cooking highlights the best of each ingredient. Crispy Brussels sprouts are true to their name, with loose and lightly charred outer layers, tender and moist within, finished with a zing of lemon zest, parsley, and aïoli. Heartier courses are thoroughly delicious, especially the pork braciole lined with breadcrumbs, pine nuts, raisins, and hard-cooked egg, then seared and served in a chunky tomato sauce."
"Huertas","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.huertasnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Huertas is lovely-even lovelier than you might expect for its gritty location. The casual space is deep, with a long bar pouring cider or sherry, dedicated counter where a host of cured meats including jamón is sliced, and larger tables in the back. The Basque-leaning menu showcases pintxos like stuffed and batter-fried squash blossoms, duck croquetas, and skewers of white anchovies with olives and pickled peppers. The selection of conservas promises the type of fare that only the Spanish can do, as in zamburiñas in a complex tomato sauce with lemon, herbs, and bread topped with a heavy drizzle of mayo. A handful of larger platos round out the menu with dishes like deep-fried porgy with toasted garlic, pickled chilies, and manzanilla olives."
"Houseman","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.housemanrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Just around the corner from the legendary Ear Inn, you'll find this amazing offering courtesy of Chef/owner Ned Baldwin. Sporting a small, but sharply designed interior by Louis Yoh, replete with schoolhouse chairs and reclaimed bowling alley wood tables, Houseman's seasonal menu isn't extensive, but each dish is extremely well-sourced-not to mention well-executed, with the help of co-chef, Adam Baumgart. Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers. Then linger over a superbly fresh, slashed, and fried whole black sea bass, laced with a tarragon-forward herby sauce; or excellent, beer-braised sausage links, served with sweet caramelized onions and roasted banana peppers."
"Hometown Bar-B-Que","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hometownbarbque.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Texas-style barbecue has come to Brooklyn, even if this 'cue begins in an 18-foot smoke pit located a few blocks away. And yet this kitchen remains focused on creamy mac n' cheese, whiskey sour pickles, and mayo-mustardy potato salad. Meats arrive tender enough to have a caramel crunch- for instance, coated in a blackened peppery bark, the beef rib is obscenely large, deliciously moist and mighty popular. Sausages snap and explode with juice and chili-spiced bite (each is sold by the plump quarter-pound link), while desserts are less provocative and may feature a simple banana cream pudding. The warehouse-like space is clad in repurposed wood with communal picnic tables lending an intimate and friendly vibe. Water Taxi is the easiest way here from Manhattan."
"Himalayan Yak","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.himalayanyak.net","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Broadly appealing yet truly unique, Himalayan Yak transports diners from Jackson Heights to Central Asia for a hybrid of Nepalese, Tibetan, and Indian cuisines. The room is a bit worn-a testament to its long-standing popularity-but orange walls invoke mountain sunsets; carved dark wood and colorful fabrics create a far-flung ambience. Start with an order of momo: these steamed minced meat-filled dumplings are seasoned with scallions, cilantro, and ginger. Then sample yak in the form of sausage, stew, or cheese. Labsha is a beef and daikon curry served with tingmo, a multi-layered steamed bun for sopping up the mildly spiced sauce, which simply must not be missed. And finally the lassi, a traditional yogurt-based drink, is the perfect complement to every meal."
"Hirohisa","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hirohisa-nyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","There’s nothing like a discreet entrance to raise expectations—and Hirohisa is nicely concealed on Thompson Street. When you do find it, you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that looks like a page from Wallpaper magazine. It’s run with considerable charm by an unobtrusive and very courteous Japanese team. The two-page menu is easy to decipher with clear  headings. However, you might just be better off giving in and letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes from the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative. Standouts include the lingering, complex flavors of Kumamoto oysters wrapped in Wagyu beef carpaccio and topped with Maine sea urchin, perfectly grilled Japanese kinki, or anything with their homemade tofu. There are tables available, but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the smiling chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise."
"HinoMaru Ramen","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hinomaruramen.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","What this simple spot lacks in décor, it makes up for in charming details (think friendly service, an energetic open kitchen, and a chalkboard menu). Order a Sapporo on tap and a small plate like shrimp nikuman, shrimp tempura wrapped in a steamed bun, and prepare for the main event: truly remarkable ramen. The menu lists several slurp-worthy varieties, including a to-die-for Hakata-style tonkatsu. This pork bone distillation is vigorously simmered to produce a creamy broth infused with bone marrow and stocked with straight noodles, char siu, nori, and fishcake. Equally delicious is the vegetarian variety, a soy milk base teeming with carrots, ginger, and broccoli. For Manhattan residents, Lucky Cat, an offshoot, sits on busy East 53rd Street."
"Hill Country Chicken","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hillcountrychicken.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Gussied up in a happy palette of sunny yellow and sky blue, this 100-seat homage to deep-fried down-home country cooking serves exemplary fried chicken offered in two varieties. The ""classic"" sports a seasoned, golden-brown skin; ""Mama El's"" is skinless and cracker-crusted. Both are available by the piece or as part of whimsically named meals, like the ""white meat solo coop."" Step up to the counter and feast your eyes on cast-iron skillets of chicken, as well as sides like creamy mashed potatoes, pimento macaroni and cheese, or grilled corn salad with red peppers and green onion. And then there's pie. More than 12 assortments, baked in-house and available by the slice, whole, or blended into a milkshake for a drinkable take on ""à la mode."""
"Havana Café","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.bronxhavanacafe.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This bumping Latin café straddles a corner of the Schuylerville section, and when the weather permits, grab a seat in its palm tree-shaded sidewalk retreat. Inside, you'll find a friendly bar, ceiling fans and tropical fronds. The partners behind this operation have deep roots in the Bronx, and they've hit upon a great formula here-so much so, they've opened a second spot nearby called Cabo. The classic Cuban-American black bean soup, frijoles negro, gets a zesty kick from lime-spiked crème fraîche. Then tender palomilla is topped with caramelized onions and paired with yucca fries; while coconut rice pudding empanadas are filled with sweet dates and sided by a vanilla dipping sauce. If here on a Tuesday night, follow the conga drums on E. Tremont, where a dance party awaits."
"Hibino","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hibino-brooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The team at this demure retreat isn't constrained by a menu. Instead, diners are greeted by servers bearing blackboards that list the day's offerings. The list of obanzai (Kyoto-style tapas) are enticing and include marinated, fried chicken thigh with tartar sauce, grilled pork sausage, or roasted oysters with spicy gazpacho. The kitchen's regional dedication is also evident in its offering of Osaka's traditional hako sushi. This box-pressed preparation might be served as a layering of quality rice, shiso, kanpyo (preserved gourd), and salmon. Meanwhile, lunch is a concise affair that reveals either a bento box or platter of nigiri accompanied by a neatly stuffed futomaki. Of course, if lunch seems limited, come back for dinner when the kitchen truly shines."
"High Street on Hudson","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.highstreetonhudson.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Fresh off the success of their wildly popular Philadelphia restaurant, High Street on Market, Chef Eli Kulp has opened up this lovely little spot, just steps south of MePa to well-deserved acclaim. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available, with a focus on grains, sandwiches and wickedly good homemade breads. This airy and entertaining corner space is bright and welcoming, with a fully open kitchen and small side counter to view the action within.

"Hide-Chan Ramen","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hidechanramen.nyc","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Real, genuine tonkotsu-style ramen is happening right here in NY, thanks to Hideto Kawahara, whose ramen-ya roots run deep in Japan. These noodles are cooked exactly as customer-specified and arrive perfect every time-even for the savviest and most discerning salarymen who tend to pour in late Friday nights for the post-work, post-bar scene. But on cold days, arrive early for lunch or risk a line that is sure to snake down the stairs. In addition to their springy ramen floating in rich, fortifying broth, include other treats like crispy gyoza, traditional takoyaki, and steamed buns. For those who want to shy away from noodles, the dons are surprisingly good. The setting is appropriately informal, while service can be spacey at times."
"Hearth","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.restauranthearth.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Duck your head into beloved Hearth, its loyal patrons buzzing about as happy as ever, and you might not even notice that the kitchen has moved on to some new and exciting things. It's still delicious Italian, yes, but now the ingredients are more carefully sourced, on the healthy side, and with a deep commitment to GMO-free grains, less butter, and no processed oils. The renewed focus on vegetables, grains and brodi is a winning combination. The kitchen lights up in the vegetable arena, braising Sorana beans to perfection with sage, garlic, and mackerel ""bottarga""; or topping carrot and beet tartare with cured egg yolk, chervil and breadcrumbs. Meat lovers, take heart-Hearth's beloved braised rabbit, ribollita and ""variety burger"" are all still available."
"Hatsuhana","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hatsuhana.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's been around since the beginning of time (in NYC Japanese restaurant years) but this is no lesser a destination for excellent sushi. With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae. Stick to the counter and go omakase: the sushi will be surprisingly impressive with accommodations for the spicy tuna set. At lunch, the ""Box of Dreams"" is an aptly named must-order."
"Hasaki","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hasakinyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Since the mid-eighties, this local darling has been doing a solid business thanks to its high quality ingredients, skilled kitchen, and excellent value. For around $20, the soba lunch set will warm the heart of any frugal fan of Japanese cuisine. This generous feast features a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail, and kanpyo. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking delish sushi as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations; a Twilight menu is nice for early birds. The dining room has a clean and spare look, with seating available at a number of wood tables or sizable counter."
"Hart's","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.hartsbrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Tucked behind the elevated Franklin Avenue subway stairs, this intimate little Mediterranean venue has been causing quite a stir. A pretty slate-blue façade directs you to a small space containing whitewashed brick walls, blonde wood tables, and a skylight. A handful of seats at the low marble counter face a wall of shelved liquor bottles and offer a view into the mini kitchen. However, there is nothing mini about Chef Nick Perkins' culinary skills. In fact, he is the master of working magic out of a small kitchen. An heirloom tomato salad, laced with olive oil and crushed dried red chili, is paired with escabeche-style mussels; while a generous plate of golden pork Milanese is plated with sliced cucumber and shaved fennel for a bit of fun and flair."
"Harry's Cafe & Steak","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.harrysnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The historic Hanover Bank Building is the home to two different restaurants (albeit one kitchen). Enter through Stone Street and find the cafe. Or enter through Pearl Street and make your way into the casual, cavern-like steakhouse-a bustling space donning a convivial atmosphere with snug rooms, roomy booths, and an elegant vibe. Both are equally charming and polished-and ripe for a business meal. Start with mushroom bisque, extra rich with a splash of Sherry and dollop of crème fraîche, or Harry's salad chockablock with grilled hearts of palm, peppers, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Other successful entrées include the succulent beef Wellington, where tender baby carrots in a savory wine jus are rendered to melt-in-your-mouth precision."
"Hanjan","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hanjan26.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This contemporary take on Korean cuisine continues to thrive and is cherished among locals and visitors alike. A convivial crowd gathers along a cluster of tables in the petite space, where ivory-hued ceramic pieces are set against grey walls. Small plates arranged as ""traditional"" and ""modern"" highlight quality ingredients and stimulating presentations. The signature house-made tofu is unmissable: these chilled scoops of soybean curd are a toasty shade of brown, sprinkled with slivered green onion, sesame seeds, and accompanied by soy sauce and perilla vinaigrette. Lunch is an equally enticing affair, featuring a handful of starters, mains like bi bim bap, as well as popular noodle dishes-perhaps mixing pork belly and vegetables doused in black bean sauce."
"Harold's Meat + Three","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.haroldsmeatandthree.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This cool dude brings the global comfort food of Chef Harold Moore (formerly of Commerce) downtown to the Arlo Square Hotel dining room. With a separate bar, courtyard seating, and a modern, open layout, the vibe is au courant and family friendly. The menu concept simply involves choosing a meat or protein along with three accompanying side dishes. However, the chef's skill and international touches mean that options include Sichuan-style pork chop, steak au poivre, or fish with green curry. Sides unveil broccoli-rice casserole or smoky campfire leeks. For a few extra dollars, diners can visit the salad bar, freshly lined with lettuces, bocconcini, and house-made dressings to snack on while they wait. It also displays tempting layer cakes for dessert."
"Hao Noodle and Tea","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.haonoodle.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The full name, Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu's Kitchen, was directly imported from China-as was the regional menu offering dishes not often seen on American tables. The artsy, young, and vibrant ambience draws as many people in for authentic cooking as it does for afternoon tea. Be forewarned that the food may not all fit on your tiny table, but the accommodating kitchen is sure to plan your meal accordingly, with well-timed courses arriving and disappearing in synchronicity. Sichuan chili oil makes its creeping, tingling presence known in a wonderfully chewy presentation of spicy bean curd. Chunks of sole are expertly prepared with a crisp exterior coated in savory soy glaze. Superb taste and ""Instagrammable"" beauty is clear in each dish."
"HanGawi","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hangawirestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Beyond an ordinary façade lies this serene, shoes-off retreat with traditional low tables, Korean artifacts, and meditative music. Said footwear is stored in cubbies, seating is the color of bamboo, and clay teapots adorn the back wall. The setting is soothing, but the atmosphere is surprisingly convivial, with groups gabbing over stuffed shiitake mushrooms and green tea. The ssam bap offers a fun DIY experience with a long platter of fillings. Dark leafy lettuce and thin, herbaceous sesame leaves are topped with creamy slices of avocado, crunchy bean sprouts, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, radish, and three rice options-white, brown, and a nutty, purple-tinged multigrain. Topped with miso ssam sauce, each bite is a fresh burst of uplifting textures."
"Hakkasan","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.hakkasan.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If this sensual and sophisticated lair doesn't come to mind when you crave quality Cantonese cooking, it's high time you added it to the list. Behind its front door lies a long, moodily-lit corridor that leads to a massive dining room, which, thanks to cobalt-blue glass, Carrara marble, and mirrors, feels intimate despite its size. The equally elegant menu underscores mouthwatering dishes like jasmine tea-smoked chicken and stir-fried sugar pea pods with crabmeat and scallops; or bamboo steamers full of scallop siu mai topped with tobiko, King crab noodle rolls, as well as truffle and roasted duck bao. The prix-fixe dim sum, a wallet-friendly delight that synchs perfectly with Hakkasan's luxe tenor, is yet another decadent surprise."
"Hahm Ji Bach","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.hahmjibach.nyc","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This beloved Queens institution enjoys fine digs where they serve popular and praise-worthy Korean food. The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative, staff buzzing from table to table. It's not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates-and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue. It's hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach's delightful menu, but don't miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi, and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mackerel."
"Gran Eléctrica","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.granelectrica.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Looking to market ingredients and a California-style approach to Mexican cuisine, this chic yet comfortable restaurant impresses with its lovely décor and lively vibe. Servers are engaged and enthusiastic about the menu's pleasures. An ideal visit starts with a margarita at the bar and moves to the garden as strings of lights flicker to life. Mexico and Brooklyn are in balance on a menu that includes small plates such as memelitas de frijoles, a masa disc topped with mashed black beans, spicy salsa verde, queso fresco, and crema. Flavor is bright in the deliciously untraditional poblano chile relleno stuffed with Havarti, roasted tomato-jalapeño salsa, and tortillas. Try the frijoles de la olla (black beans topped with avocado) on the side."
"Günter Seeger NY","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.gunterseegerny.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Downtown New York will always be a place for contemporary fine dining, but Chef Seeger boldly goes against the tide of others offering serious cooking in a casually elegant setting. Here, find a dining room that feels like a part of his own home, decorated with his own artwork, wine collection, floral arrangements, and tiered drum chandeliers covered in rosy fabric. Much of the staff wear a formal mien and the orchestrated service reflects that—as do their uniforms, which are as serious as American Gothic, but still modern. Local farmers and producers influence the nightly tasting menu with exquisite ingredients that shine in the kitchen’s very capable hands. This is the eponymous chef’s first foray into NY’s dining scene (he is still a household name in his previous home city of Atlanta). And here he crafts a seasonal cuisine that is refined, yet also restrained and muted. Highlights include a cool and intensely fresh snap pea gazpacho with wild mint and shallots, followed by supremely tender beef tenderloin in a pinot noir-jus reduction. Desserts like the rote grütze (red groats) with vanilla cream and green juniper berries make it immediately clear why this is a kitchen of serious standing."
"Gramercy Tavern","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.gramercytavern.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","In a roll-call of New York’s most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people’s list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You’ll probably leave happy whether you’ve come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you’re closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The “Tavern” side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar—it doesn’t take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up “I’m not really queuing, I’m just standing here” queue outside. The “Dining Room” is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen."
"Gramercy Farmer & the Fish","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.farmerandthefish.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The kitchen is always seasonal and dishes incomparably fresh when most of the produce comes from its own farm and seafood from the owner's company. Yet loving care and creativity abound in cooking that has its own Mid-Atlantic meets New England slant, resulting in creations like a lobster roll enhanced with bone marrow. This is the kind of place to indulge in a daily array of raw seafood, butter-poached king crab, or one of their extraordinary shellfish towers. The menu goes on to offer refined all-American preparations of chicken, pork, and farm-fresh vegetables. Desserts may bear humble names but are deliciously elevated, like the ""s'mores"" made with graham cracker cookie crumbles, dark chocolate ice cream, and caramel meringue."
"Kurry Qulture","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kurryqulture.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Noted Chef Hemant Mathur and owner Sonny Solomon bring their considerable talents to this contemporary collaboration set on a busy stretch of Astoria. Inside, the vibe is friendly and casual, in an attractive room that extends from a front bar to brick-lined dining room and open back patio. The regional (and sub-regional) Indian cooking is both tasty and high achieving, beginning with mirchri ka salan featuring a complex peanut- coconut and sesame seed-base spiced with fresh-ground tamarind, curry leaf, and fenugreek. More notable is the fact that this may be a mere accompaniment to a very interesting South Indian riff on vegetarian biryani, made wonderfully fragrant with fluffy rice and jackfruit. The slow-cooked bhuna gosht is silky, gamey excellence."
"Krolewskie Jadlo","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.krolewskiejadlo.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Krolewskie Jadlo (""king's feast"" in Polish) sits in a Greenpoint enclave that was once home to a large number of Polish immigrants. Although the size of the community has decreased through the years, the area still thrives with a distinct Eastern European soul. The room is pleasant and routinely packed with crowds basking in the enjoyable authenticity. The Polish plate brings all one could hope for in a hearty old-world platter: cabbage rolls stuffed with ground beef and braised in tart tomato sauce; pan-fried potato pierogis; and a link of smoky kielbasa. Other items are just as tasty, like the pounded pork shoulder steak, grilled and brushed with honey, and served with pickled cabbage and beets. Known for their dessert make sure to end on a sweet note."
"Krupa Grocery","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.krupagrocery.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Since its arrival on the scene, Krupa Grocery has been a hit that makes you want to become a regular right out of the gate. Owner Peter Cooke's food is so simple and perfectly calibrated, it's hard to miss. Get things started with country toast, served alongside delicious spreads like smashed pea and fava bean with pecorino, tarragon vinaigrette, and pea leaves; or whipped lardo with radish, caper salad, and parsley. For dinner, try buttermilk-fried skate set over cracked hominy with basil seeds and salsa verde. Brunch is also a slam dunk here and is alone worth a visit. Designed with a long industrial bar that's ideal for solo eating or lingering couples, the interior is effortlessly cool, but the place to be come summer is undoubtedly the gorgeous backyard."
"Kosaka","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kosakanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Lauded chef Yoshihiko Kousaka, formerly of Jewel Bako, takes the wheel at this wonderful sushi house, partnering with Key Kim and Mihyun Han to offer two shimmering and new omakase menus. The room is sleek and modern, with a handsome Japanese sensibility and a counter for 12, along with three small tables. A relaxed, but deeply attentive service staff rounds out this wonderful little gem. Much of the fish laid out over the course of the night is imported from Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market, though some of it is procured from local purveyors. But each bright, immaculate slice-be it King salmon with smoked soy sauce, scallop with sea grapes and yuzu, or kelp-cured and pressed striped jack-is wildly fresh, cut-to-order, and seasoned with the lightest hand possible."
"Kunjip","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kunjip.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The first thing you need to know about this wildly popular restaurant is that it's open 24 hours. The second thing you need to know is that it's actually good. Even better news? An expansion has created additional seating in this two-level dining room, done up in spare, earthy hues and traditional wooden screens. It's classic, clean and simple-the message is clear. At Kunjip, the focus is most decidedly on the food. Barbecue is always popular, and is done quite well at dinner. The menu, however, reaches much wider with a long list of hearty soups (a big hit with the lunch crowd), stews, and casseroles. Everything is excellent, but a steaming bowl of galbitang-bobbing with tender and fatty short rib, glass noodles and juicy daikon slivers-truly transcends."
"Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kfdelicacy.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","With its lineup of traditionally prepared comfort food, this steamy joint kicks Hell's Kitchen's Chinese competitors to the curb. Set among the bright lights of the Theater District yet more indicative of the noodle houses found south of Canal Street or along Flushing Avenue, the perpetually packed gem offers a so-so ambience but very friendly service. Hand-pulled and hand-cut noodles are stir-fried with a number of mouthwatering accompaniments; while the dumpling variety is so great it's almost impossible to focus. Herb-spiked pork and shrimp wonton soup is well worth the 20-minute wait, allowing diners plenty of time to devour pan-fried Peking duck bundles and scallion pancakes stuffed with sliced beef; or steamed buns full of mushroom and bok choy."
"Ko","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.momofuku.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","Once you’ve worked out that the little peach motif actually indicates the entrance, you’ll find yourself taking a seat at what the theatrical world would call a thrust stage. This extraordinarily handsome three-sided counter is wrapped around an open kitchen where the evening’s performance takes place. Each element just works so well here: from the judicious lighting that makes everything feel more sensual, to the music (never too intrusive but far from anodyne) and the delightful team of servers who appear ninja-style from nowhere to be at your side when you need something. Counters are usually such elbow-y affairs, but this one is so wide and everyone is so spread out that you could barely touch your neighbor with a stick. There is no à la carte for you to waste time examining. The multi-course set menu has been expertly honed, practiced and refined. Completed dishes are handed over by the chefs, who may have perfected the bad boy/girl looks of the modern urban cook, but speak with unalloyed pride when they describe what you’re about to eat. Each perfectly formed dish delivers flavors that are refined yet assured, innovative yet expertly balanced; clever yet ridiculously easy to eat."
"Kitchen 79","","Under 25 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kitchen79nyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Shiny black subway tiles and glowing fixtures set a dateworthy tone at this new Thai standout. Patient, helpful servers assist in exploring the menu, focused mainly on dishes of southern Thailand. Patrons can choose to be as adventurous as the sometimes familiar yet authentic and funky menu allows. Thick green curry (gaeng kiew warn) is packed with tender shrimp, bamboo shoots, eggplant, Chinese long beans, and holy basil simmered in coconut milk with pleasantly restrained spicing. A whole flounder (pla neung ma nao) is brilliant, distinct, and steamed to perfection with sour and spicy notes from garlic, minced ginger, and a Thai hot sauce. Flat noodles (ka nom jeen gang tai pla) with pumpkin, mackerel, and curry paste is a powerful, spicy dish."
"King","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kingrestaurant.nyc","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's still a fresh face on the SoHo dining scene, but King boasts a rare coziness that restaurants can take ages to acquire. The popular bar area leads to an intimate rear dining space lined with blonde wood mirrors. Chef/owners Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt met while working at London's esteemed River Café, then banded together with Annie Shi to open King. The talented kitchen brings a deft touch to their brief, daily-changing menu, pulled straight from the greenmarket. A tangle of warm green and wax beans are tossed with torn mint, excellent parmesan, and an exquisite extra virgin olive oil. Wildly good halibut is seasoned with restraint, then cooked to succulent perfection and plated with fresh-from-the-market wilted spinach and zucchini trifolati."
"Khe-Yo","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kheyo.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This Laotian hot spot serves up vibrant family-style plates brimming with tart and spicy notes that pack a punch-make that a Bang Bang, actually, as in the house sauce of mixed chilies, cilantro, fish sauce, and garlic served to diners as a welcome, along with a basket of sticky rice. The food is worth braving the wait and decibel levels, so sip a craft brew or cocktail before digging in. Start with a plate of wide rice noodles and bits of slow-cooked pork in a coconut-rich yellow curry garnished with herbs, bean sprouts, and slivered banana blossom. Banana leaf-steamed red snapper is another beautifully prepared item, paired with crisped artichoke hearts, Chinese broccoli, and more of that sauce. Bright and bitter grapefruit sorbet is a fitting finish."
"Kingsley","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kingsleynyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The crowds are clamoring for a table at this East Village charmer, and for good reason: Kingsley's splurge-worthy cuisine is sophisticated, surprising, and delicious. And the cozy space makes for a rare oasis amid the neighborhood's raucous dining scene. Featuring an interesting juxtaposition of flavors and textures while being reminiscent of classic fare, dinner here might begin with a ridiculously fresh summer bean salad starring cranberries, rattlesnake, and Romano beans paired with bacon marmalade, crème fraîche and sautéed spicy greens. Soft, chewy wild rice noodles are topped with stir-fried mushrooms and Asian greens, just as a heavenly Wagyu Basses-Côtes steak arrives with velvety Fairy Tale eggplant, grilled potato, and a streak of chimichurri."
"Kings County Imperial","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kingscountyimperial.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","While this 'hood has enjoyed a rush of good restaurants in recent years, Kings County Imperial created a stir within the stir. The décor is nothing to write home about-though it's cute and disheveled in all the right ways and boasts a mean ""backyard."" But, their pan-Chinese dishes have certainly set tongues a wagging. Think juicy white broiler chicken dumplings laced with cinnamon-red oil and Kings County Soy Works (carried on tap, fresh from the Pearl River Delta in Southern China); or creamy kung pao sweet potatoes paired with silky king trumpet mushrooms. A salt-and-pepper pork chop features outstanding quality meat; while tender tea-smoked moo shu duck, marinated for 48 hours, is paired with soft homemade wheat pancakes."
"Kiin Thai","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kiinthaieatery.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Smack in the middle of NYU turf and on a street choking with fast-casual eateries, Kiin Thai cuts an impressive figure design-wise, with its lofty ceilings and light-filled interior. While value-driven lunch specials might on occasion affect quality, the kitchen continues to push out precise renditions of Central and Northern Thai dishes. Khao soi is a gorgeous orange-hued curry with chewy noodles, tender braised chicken, hard-boiled egg, and the requisite condiments needed to amp the dish up to an incendiary level. Other faves include fish hor mok-a custardy curry with striped sea bass, coconut milk, and duck eggs-topped with herbs and Makrut lime; or the excellent hor nueng gai with chicken, Thai eggplant, and rice, delicately steamed in a banana leaf."
"Kesté Pizza & Vino","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kestepizzeria.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Mamma mia! New York's love affair with Kesté shows no sign of stopping. This kitchen begins with a puffy, blistered crust that's perfectly salty and tangy, then tops it with ingredients like roasted butternut squash purée, smoked mozzarella and basil. And while its ingredients seem to have taken a small hit in recent years, that crust is still on point. Co-owner Roberto Caporuscio presides over the American chapter of Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, and his daughter, Giorgia, oversees the in-house pizza making operations. Diners can choose from more than 22 pizzas (including a few gluten-free options), a roster of calzoni, and nightly pie specials. The restaurant is teeny-tiny, but diners are encouraged to linger, in true Italian hospitality."
"Keens","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.keens.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's not just carnivores who'll appreciate this most classic of steakhouses; Anglophiles, social historians, Scotch lovers and pipe smokers will also find themselves revelling in the immeasurably appealing atmosphere of Keens and its palpable sense of times past. Established in 1885, it suggests a Dickensian Gentleman's club, with its dark wood panelling and low ceiling lined with thousands of clay pipes, although these days the customers are mostly deal-making business types rather than extravagantly whiskered thespians. Follow their lead and drape your jacket over the back of your chair, roll up your sleeves and attempt to gain control over a Porterhouse steak, dry-aged in-house, or finish their legendary mutton chop in one sitting."
"Katz's","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.katzsdelicatessen.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","One of the last-standing, old-time Eastern European spots on the Lower East Side, Katz's is a true NY institution. It's crowded, crazy, and packed with a panoply of characters weirder than a jury duty pool. Tourists, hipsters, blue hairs, and everybody in between flock here, so come on off-hours. Because it's really that good. Walk inside, get a ticket, and don't lose it (those guys at the front aren't hosts-upset their system and you'll get a verbal beating). Then pick up your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table. Nothing's changed in the looks or taste. Matzo ball soup, pastrami sandwiches, potato latkes-everything is what you'd expect, only better."
"Katsuno","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.katsunorestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","To find Katsuno, look for the white lantern and those traditional noren curtains. Featuring less than ten tables, what this Japanese jewel lacks in size it makes up for in flavor and attitude. The owner's wife greets each guest at the door, while Chef Katsuyuki Seo dances around the miniscule kitchen crafting precise Japanese dishes from top-quality ingredients. His elegant plating of sashimi may reveal the likes of amberjack topped with a chiffonade of shiso, luxurious sea urchin, translucent squid crested with needle-thin yuzu zest, as well as supremely fresh fluke, tuna, and mackerel. Meanwhile, carb fans will enjoy a warm bowl of soba in duck broth with tender duck breast; or the fantastically brothy inaniwa udon, served only on special nights."
"Karczma","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.karczmabrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Located in a slice of Greenpoint that still boasts a sizeable Polish population, Karczma offers a lovely old-world ambience that perfectly matches its very traditional and budget-friendly menu. The kitchen has been known to turn out a host of hearty offerings, including peasant-style lard mixed with bacon and spices, or even a plate of the nation's specialties piled high with pierogies (three varieties, steamed or fried, topped with onions and butter), kielbasa, potato pancakes and stuffed cabbage. Grilled plates can be prepared for two or three, while others like the roasted hocks in beer, could easily feed an army. The quaint, farmhouse-inspired interior is efficiently staffed with smiling servers in floral skirts and embroidered vests."
"Kafana","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kafananyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If the Eastern European intelligentsia needed somewhere to plan a revolution or maybe just talk politics, they would meet here. Walls papered with Cyrillic newspapers set a deliciously covert scene, yet overall, the effect is inviting. The menu highlights Serbian fare that is hard to find in Manhattan. That said, some specialties will seem familiar, like zeljanica, a buttery wedge of classic phyllo pie folded with chopped spinach, garlic, herbs, and feta. Unique dishes feature dried prunes stuffed with crumbly cheese, rolled in chicken liver and bacon. Also try gently dredged and fried spearing fish, piled on butcher paper with urbenes dip. Ćevapi are the catchall for sausages from the same area and here they highlight finely ground pork with herbs."
"Kanoyama","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.kanoyama.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","The spotlight shines here on the seriously talented Chef Nobuyuki Shikanai and commands the rear room’s attention as he performs his magic before the few coveted seats along his omakase counter. Beyond this, the space has a row of tables where you might observe a group indulging in a tuna rib that appears large enough to have come from a cow: first sliced raw, then cooked to enjoy this incredibly fresh fish both ways. Ancillary rooms almost feel like a sushi-ya within a sushi-ya. The service team is swift and friendly even as they work in the shadow of their master. Kanoyama's omakase is a profoundly personal experience, as Chef Shikanai slices, cuts, and brushes, dabs, and perfects each morsel before presenting it to you with cupped hands, to be taken with your fingers. Pieces are precisely crafted yet delicate and beautiful in that traditional Edomae style. Overall, the meal is a progression from light, firm fish to vivid, buttery salmon and toro with exciting stops along the way, like cherry trout hakozushi (box-pressed) or jackfish with grains of Icelandic sea salt and a drizzle of lemon. Finish with an extraordinary block of cake-like tamago topped with a silken yolk."
"Kajitsu","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kajitsunyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","It’s the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food—but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism— if you’re in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The traditionally decorated space on the second floor is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you’ll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It’s all about balance, harmony and simplicity—and allowing the ingredients’ natural flavors to shine, whether it’s the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature."
"Jungsik","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.jungsik.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","Cool, chic, and completely urbane, Jungsik is the epitome of contemporary elegance. Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter—the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin; then it is served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette. Artful desserts include black raspberry and coconut sorbet with crumbles of spinach cake, yuzu meringue, and perfect berry slices."
"Junoon","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.junoonnyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Creative cuisine, attention to detail and a stunning décor set Junoon apart from its upscale Indian associates. Step through the restaurant’s ebony wood doors, and you’ll find a dramatic, welcoming space adorned with treasures from the subcontinent. The large bar up front, replete with two antique jhoolas (swings) crafted from Burmese teak, delivers sophistication and fun—and by day, lunch is served in the light and airy (Patiala) room. Dinner guests are treated to the more theatrical room, walking along the length of the space through an ancient wooden arch and carved panels, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool. This leads to an amber-tinted dining area where tables are luxuriously spaced. The overall effect is exotic, luxe and transporting—not easily forgotten. The talented kitchen team is particularly adept at bringing out contrasting flavors and textures in vegetarian dishes. A plate of kofta paneer, highlighting soft cottage cheese-like dumplings with a crisp exterior, puddled in a mustard-greens curry studded with English peas and abundant chilies, reaches epic heights when paired with a cheese-filled naan. But for a truly regal affair, opt for the chicken biryani-aromatic, moist and perfectly spiced."
"Jun-Men Ramen Bar","","Under 25 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.junmenramen.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This cool West Chelsea ramen shop is a hot ticket-and with less than two dozen seats, a short wait can be expected at lunchtime. Slick and bright, the grey and white space is accentuated by the stainless steel implements of the open kitchen, where two hot tub-sized stock pots of pork broth bubble away. That marrow-rich broth is the foundation for a succulent bowlful of toothsome straight noodles topped with simmered bamboo shoots, delightfully fatty chasu, shoyu tamago with a liquid gold yolk, and a splash of fermented garlic oil for good measure. Spicy miso and kimchi are delicious variations on the theme, while small plates offer tastes like pork buns, fried sweet potatoes, and yellowtail crudo dressed with pickled mango and kimchi."
"Loring Place","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.loringplacenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Named after the Bronx street that his father grew up in, Loring Place is where Chef Dan Kluger serves up delicious, stylistic, and locally sourced Californian cuisine to a downtown crowd. And yet, none of this comes as a surprise as the chef has showcased his talents for years and been the recipient of much acclaim in the city. Following this, his cooking here is unique and spirited, starting with caramelized cauliflower served with chilies and Meyer lemon jam. Leeks arrive cool and tender, dressed with sherry vinaigrette, set over yogurt, and finished with pear slices. Then duck breast is prepared with rare skill and finesse. The generously sized room is uncluttered and mid-century chic, with bright orange window frames and boldly striped banquettes."
"Locanda Vini e Olii","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.locandany.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","While regulars at this beloved Clinton Hill trattoria know just where to go, the uninitiated may be surprised to find it tucked underneath a sign that reads Lewis Drug Store. Old-school without feeling hyper-designed, the ambience at this re-purposed apothecary is truly special. Envision lace-covered windows, a penny-tile floor, and ladder-fronted shelves filled with vintage glassware and cookbooks. Tuscany influences the cooking here, where the diverse list of antipasti includes tripe alla Fiorentina, and the pasta is expertly prepared, like a luscious tangle of chitarra con le sarde. Salads follow entrées on the menu, but no one will raise an eyebrow if you order the baby spinach with roasted beets and pecorino before the charred poussin al mattone."
"Llama Inn","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.llamainnnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Upbeat, modern, and cool, the Llama Inn pays respect to all styles of Peruvian cooking, but with the technical flair of a chef who has trained in New York's top restaurants. The result is a fresh, fun, and spontaneous cuisine that aims to elevate Peruvian food. Fish courses are notable, and nowhere is that more clear than in the fresh and expertly cut raw sea bream tiradito with persimmon, ginger, yuzu, and nutty poppy seeds. Fluke ceviche is just as memorable, served in a bit of dashi with lime, onion, cilantro, aji, and wonderfully spicy leche de tigre. Then move on to devour decadent little skewers of pork belly brushed with Chinese five-spice, soy, garlic, and barbecue sauce. Excellent desserts include airy coffee mousse with chocolate and lucuma."
"Locanda Verde","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.locandaverdenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This ever-trendy yet refined Italian ristorante is as much coveted for its gorgeous setting as its lineup of rustic, tasty fare. The ambience is always abuzz and everyone looks beautiful amid low lights, a long bar, and walls adorned with wine bottles. Breakfast verges on divine-think lemon pancakes and apple cider doughnuts. Bare tables are packed throughout the day with a stylish crowd waxing poetic about crostini topped with blue crab and jalapeño. Also try terrific house-made pasta such as pappardelle with lamb Bolognese, finished with a dollop of sheep's milk ricotta, or paccheri dressed in ""Sunday night ragù."" No one should leave without sampling superb sweets, like the apple and concord grape crostata with rosemary hazelnut brittle and brown butter gelato."
"Little Park","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.littlepark.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Little Park flaunts that upscale downtown feel that TriBeCa seems to have trademarked. Yet Chef Min Kong delivers a personal and unique cuisine that distinguishes it from other Andrew Carmellini restaurants. Here, vegetables are often put front and center on the plate, with meat and seafood serving as accents. This means that the harmonious flavors of beet tartare with rye crumbs, dill, and smoked trout roe is just as impressive as the crisp-skinned tilefish with bok choy and black radish in toasted rice dashi. Masterful desserts include the frozen Meyer lemon ""fluff"" with meringue, orange sorbet, and candied ginger. Diners take note-while the Smyth Hotel lobby bar operates at capacity early in the evening, this dining room starts buzzing at a later hour."
"Liebman's","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.liebmansdeli.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Some things never change (phew!) and thankfully this iconic kosher deli is still stuffing sandwiches and ladling matzoh ball soup (reputed for its healing powers), just as it has for over 50 years. Residents wax poetic about the place: a true-blue deli with a neon sign in the front window, the grill slowly roasting hot dogs, and meat-slicing machines churning out endless piles of pastrami. Soulful classics include stuffed veal breast, potato latkes, and tongue sandwiches with tangy pickles. Some order to-go, but a hearty Reuben stacked with mounds of hot corned beef, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing is more enjoyable when freshly plated and served in a comfortable booth. End with a perfect little rugelach filled with chocolate and ground nuts."
"Leuca","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.leuca.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This well-curated addition to the booming local scene arrives courtesy of NoHo Hospitality Group with the talented Andrew Carmellini at the helm. Named for the charming maritime town in the southernmost region of Puglia, Italy, Brooklyn’s Leuca is tucked into the gorgeous William Vale Hotel, a stone’s throw from the East River. The lovely space features a bright and airy dining room with yellow leather chairs and marble-topped tables, as well as a second elegant nook fitted out with wood paneling and oversized black-and-white photographs. Dinner might unveil tender lemon chicken for two, fragrant with spices and strung with blistered peppers; or a delicious tangle of spaghetti and sea urchin topped with succulent crab and spicy chili flakes."
"Lilia","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.lilianewyork.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Who's not happy to see Missy Robbins back on the culinary scene, whipping up pastas that could bring the savviest diner to their knees? Tucked amongst the mish-mash of shiny new condos and the roar of the BQE that make up this part of Williamsburg, sleek Lilia occupies an old corner auto shop. The transformation is dramatic, replete with iron casement windows, unique tiling, and contemplative artwork. Most of the dishes at Lilia ooze authenticity, made all the better by a warm, knowledgeable service staff who are happy to elaborate on details. Dinner might begin with cured sardines laid over a thick slice of sourdough, dotted with dill and capers; or chewy rigatoni diavola in a chunky tomato-based salsa humming with chili pepper and salty pecorino."
"Legend Bar & Restaurant","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.legendbarrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","While Legend may offer a variety of Asian fare, just stick to the Sichuan specialties and be thoroughly rewarded. Find one of the many highlights in supremely flavorful and tender Chong Qing spicy chicken, loaded with viciously good dried chilies. The house duck is a traditional presentation of roasted and crisped meat with wraps as well as a host of accoutrements, including crushed peanuts, fragrant herbs, scallions, and tasty plum sauce. Bok choy with black mushrooms is a crunchy, simply delicious departure from the intensity of other dishes you may face here. The dining room has a certain hip and chic feel that fosters a lively happy hour scene. Colorful fabrics, striped walls, and statues of deities make for an attractive space."
"Lea","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.leabrooklyn.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Italian is the name of the game at this stylish restaurant, where diners tuck into refined versions of the country's favorite dishes-try the tender eggplant, baked to silky perfection with fragrant basil, milky mozzarella and chunky tomato sauce. Don't miss a plate of chewy grilled squid, served over sheep's milk yogurt and cucumbers; or soft meatballs pocked with pine nuts and raisins in a mouthwatering sauce. A sublime, tart-like cheesecake is sure to seal the deal. Settled on a prime corner location with sidewalk seating and a sexy, all-glass façade, Lea is a head-turner. The interior is fitted with unique accents (dismantled water tower ""art,"" anyone?) while the overall vibe is breezy, stylish and welcoming."
"Le Turtle","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.leturtle.fr","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Experience and style converge at this beautiful destination and instant favorite of the cool kids in town. The cuisine is not only as attractive as the setting, but sophisticated flavors ensure its success. Kohlrabi bisque is deliciously creamy, with ambitious garnishes like smoked cabbage, pickled mustard seeds, and bits of intensely rich lamb belly to make it savory and very memorable. Straightforward skill is clear in the scored curls of squid served with a refreshing salsa verde, embellished with oroblanco. Every flavor is perfectly complementary in the dense and buttery hazelnut financier, from the chewy caramelized edges to the quenelles of lemon yogurt sorbet and pear purée. A moderately priced list showcases unique and interesting French wines."
"Le Gigot","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.legigotrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","At first glance, Le Gigot transports guests to an inviting little family-owned bistro-the kind you'd only find in La Ville-Lumière. The service exceeds expectations with uncharacteristic warmth that brings a welcoming vibe to the nostalgic dining room. Tasty renditions of classic bistro fare dominate the menu, so expect the cooking to be familiar and pleasing. The petit bouillabaisse begins as a saffron fish broth with a red-peppery North African accent to elevate the traditional fish and seafood dish. Their cassoulet is a beloved Toulousaine version with duck confit, bacon, cannellini beans, herbs, and luscious pork. Finally, brioche pudding conjures all that is simple and good in a dessert, with crème anglaise, berries, and whipped cream."
"Le Garage","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.legaragebrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","As the name implies, this chic Bushwick address once housed a garage. Nowadays, you’ll find a bright and cheerful space boasting whitewashed brick walls, sleek blonde wood, and sunny yellow accents. The walls are hung with old black-and-white photographs of co-owner Catherine Allswang’s previous restaurants in Paris. Now, with Le Garage, she partners with her daughter Rachel to bring a contemporary French menu to Brooklyn. Classic dishes like leeks vinaigrette are cooked to silky perfection, and served chilled with finely diced hard-boiled egg. However, their heartier options are just as impressive: imagine the likes of slow-cooked pork cheek dressed with savory pan juices, pink grapefruit segments, braised radicchio, and peppery watercress."
"Le Fond","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.lefondbk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chef-owner Jake Eberle's cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He's a French-trained chef whose cooking is crisp, clean, and comfortingly classic-and his well-balanced menu includes words like ""roulade"" and ""blancmange"" that here seem curiously reassuring. That's not to say his food doesn't pack a punch: the rich, meaty cassoulet could keep an army on the march for days. Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The acoustics can be bouncy and those lacking the necessary padding will find the seating a little numbing. But, there is honest toil and earnest endeavor happening here and it deserves support."
"Le Coucou","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.lecoucou.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chef Daniel Rose made a name for himself when he opened his popular Paris bistro, Spring. And now that France's favorite American ex-pat has returned home to work this spot with Philadelphia-based restaurateur Stephen Starr, it's only natural to find a white-hot scene. At Le Coucou, crowds linger late into the night amid plush velvet chairs, custom chandeliers, and a menu that infuses classic French food with a strong dose of cool. A seat in the dining room with a view of the open kitchen will serve you well. From there, the carte-arranged under three headings-offers such ace items as buckwheat-fried Montauk eel plated with pickled cucumber and a warm curry vinaigrette. Set atop potato pureé, pigeon et homard with a reduced jus leaves a lasting impression."
"Laut","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.lautnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Laut is a unique Malaysian restaurant that is at once cheerful and authentic, yet never challenging or inaccessible. It is likewise true to its downtown spirit, in a room that features dim lighting and exposed brick adorned with chalk drawings of orchids and water lilies. The personable staff and menu of Southeast Asian delights are as steady as the constant crowd. Popular choices include roti telur, a thin and slightly crisped yet pliable pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs, onions, and peppers, paired with fragrant coconut chicken curry. The nasi lemak is a dome of coconut rice surrounded with sweet chili shrimp, hard-boiled egg, roasted peanuts, and dried anchovies for mixing into an outrageously good mélange of Malaysian flavors."
"Le Coq Rico","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.lecoqriconyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chicken takes the spotlight at Le Coq Rico, but these birds go well beyond the basic. Tucked into a gleaming interior at the base of a Beaux-Arts building, the restaurant offers two distinct dining areas-the main room with its stylized décor of whitewashed brick and white oak floors, as well as a glossy counter area overlooking the open kitchen. There is a list of chicken breeds to choose from including Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire and Rohan Farm Duck. The menu offers plenty to mull over-imagine eggs, soups, and salads of sautéed guinea fowl and artichokes à la Barigoule. Finally, mains like chicken fricassée sided by rice pilaf or Maine lobster served with shellfish jus are just as delightful as a dessert of vanilla-raspberry vacherin."
"Le Bernardin","Three  Stars","Over 75 USD","Top class comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.le-bernardin.com","Three Stars • Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey","When the definitive history of New York City’s dining scene is written, Le Bernardin will have a chapter all to itself. Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert’s midtown icon has been entertaining the city’s movers and shakers for over 20 years now and its popularity remains undimmed. In less experienced hands, the sheer size and scale of this handsome restaurant could make it unwieldy, but the service team is well-drilled and clued-up and as soon as you walk in you are enveloped in its warm embrace. Lunch is busy with those who know what they want and trust this well-oiled machine to deliver it in the time they have available. Come at dinner for a more languid affair. The menu is divided into headings of ""Almost raw,"" ""Barely touched,"" and ""Lightly cooked,"" but don't be fooled, these dishes have considerable depth. Seafood restaurants have no hiding place when it comes to cooking fish and crustaceans and this kitchen always hits its marks-whether that's poaching halibut, pan-roasting monkfish, baking striped bass, searing tuna or charring octopus. And the fish is always the star on the plate, while the accompanying ingredients, like great backing singers, are there to help it shine."
"Lavagna","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.lavagnanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna's kitchen is snug, but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizzette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options can include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper-topped crostini, juicy rack of lamb, or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce. Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling, and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors will feel welcome and well taken care of."
"Larb Ubol","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.larbubol.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The larb here really is good enough to be the restaurant's namesake as these spicy, crunchy, salty and herb-y salads sing with flavor. Yet Larb Ubol does much more with equal skill: the sheer size of their massive chicken wings defy nature, yielding enough crisp-skinned and chili-coated meat to satisfy any appetite. Yum moo krob mixes impossibly tender pork with abundant green chilies in a fish sauce dressing for a brilliant counterpoint in flavor; while kai jeow, a Thai-style omelet, is an unexpectedly comforting dish that highlights excellent technique. There may be a choice of three fillings, but the pickled garlic can't be beat. The space itself is no more than basic; the location is, well, meh. Service is friendly, though not necessarily speedy."
"Lakruwana","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.lakruwana.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Prepare for a sensory overload the moment you set foot into Lakruwana-the Sri Lankan hot spot is covered from floor-to-ceiling in murals, sculptures, flags, and more. The bright kaleidoscope of textures and colors is a welcome sight in an otherwise downtrodden part of the borough, as is the energetic owner who drifts from table to table. Those familiar with Indian food will love Lakruwana's abundance of curries, green chili-spiked kuttu roti, as well as refreshingly salty-and-sour lassi. But their flavorful fare is considerably spicier, packing heat into everything from fiery red chili lunu miris chutney to deviled chicken. Loaded with ginger and garlic, this stellar tomato-based chicken specialty comes with cooling raita and tangy vegetable curry."
"Land of Plenty","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.landofplenty58.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Why do they call it Land of Plenty? Perhaps it's because of the abundant flavors in Chongqing noodles puddled in a chili oil broth with ground pork, peanuts and sesame seeds; or bean curd bathed in...yes...more chili oil with toasted peanuts and Sichuan peppercorns. Then imagine green snow pea sprouts dusted with salt and garlic, or pork dumplings swimming in a soy- peanut- and chili-bath that's spicy, sweet and salty at once. And know that these are just a few of the plentiful reasons. Though the focus here is definitely the food, this fiery haven feels more elegant than the other Sichuan spots in midtown. Tucked into a sleek, subterranean space, the décor features marble floors and mosaic-tile walls. A professional service staff helps further set the tone."
"La Vara","One  Star","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.lavarany.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Chef Alex Raij knows her tapas. She helped kickstart the craze in Manhattan when she opened her beloved Tía Pol years ago. From there, she moved on to the equally popular El Quinto Pino. And in 2012, she brought her beloved style to Brooklyn via La Vara, which she co-owns with her husband, Eder Montero. It’s been a hit since day one. La Vara bills itself as “cocina casera” or home cooking, but this tapas den elevates the humble cuisine to such impressive levels that it’s well worth the cab trip for non-Brooklynites. Product quality is excellent, and the playful spirit at work in the lineup of cold and hot small plates is the definition of creative cooking. Think crunchy fried sea anemone served in a chilled purée of almonds, bread, and garlic, drizzled with huitlacoche oil; or tender rabbit loin puddled in delicious sweet onion vinaigrette. Tucked into a charming brownstone-lined enclave of Cobble Hill, this small, slender space is chic and cozy, with red brick walls and a little white marble counter lined with glossy, high-backed chairs. A curved tan leather booth and small white tables dot the room. It's an atmosphere meant to put you at ease, with a menu guaranteed to wow."
"La Sirena","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.lasirena-nyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Here come empire-builders Chef Mario Batali and partner Joe Bastianich to rev up the Chelsea scene even further with this revamped Maritime Hotel dining room. La Sirena is anchored by a pretty lounge, where the custom mosaic-tiled floor endures a nightly stampede of stilettos; a wall of glass overlooking an expansive patio allows the sunset to glint off the bar. Having honed his skills at Casa Mono, Chef Anthony Sasso displays his tapas expertise at this gleaming bar, featuring a separate menu devoted solely to these small plates as well as a unique selection of Spanish wines. But for proper dining, seek out the cached dining rooms where sleek leather furnishings and fine service offer hushed comfort. Pastas like lasagne al pesto e patate or tonnarelli neri with seafood are a highlight and best enjoyed as the bis portion, split between you and your guest. Then panelle, mint, and pomegranate molasses combine for a Sicilian-inspired backdrop to succulent lamb chops. When asked if you would like bread, your answer should be enthusiastically affirmative-the freshly baked semolina rolls are fabulous. Campari-soaked babà is an unconventional but delightful pastry nicely paired with basil gelato."
"La Morada","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.lamoradanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Tucked among the many Willis Avenue bodegas, this sweet spot stands out for its authentic Oaxacan food. It's a homey, no frills sort of place that welcomes everyone, and the owner loves to chat about the traditions behind this region's cooking-or history or art as evidenced by the impromptu lending library that has emerged in the comfy back seating area. This part of Mexico is known for its incredible moles, so sample a wonderfully complex red pumpkin seed version (pipián rojo de pepitas) with pork spare ribs. Another, the glossy mole Oaxaqueño, arrives fragrant with cloves, tomatillos, plantains, peanuts and chocolate, served over chicken. Don't miss the wildly fresh tamales either, filled with silky chicken, spices and covered with a rich tomatillo sauce."
"La Grenouille","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.la-grenouille.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamor and manners with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there's always room for local newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish space, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the room with rose and apricot hues. Classic and classy, this French cuisine deserves high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; an exquisitely tender-seared beef filet arrives with pommes Darphin and a lick of perfect sauce au poivre; and for dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel."
"La Esquina","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.esquinanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","When La Esquina opened it was a breath of bright air, offering enjoyably fresh cuisine that stood tall among the paltry selection of Manhattan Mexican. Thankfully, the city's south-of-the-border dining scene has evolved since then. However, this idol remains a fun and worthy option. More playground than restaurant, the multi-faceted setting takes up an iconic downtown corner and draws a hip crowd to its grab and go taqueria, 30-seat café, and subterranean dining room-cum-bar. The spirit here is alive and kicking, with classic renditions of tortilla soup; mole negro enchiladas filled with excellently seasoned chicken; as well as carne asada starring black Angus sirloin with mojo de ajo. A baby sib in Brooklyn continues to thrive thanks to its retro vibe."
"L'Appart","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.lappartnyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Secreted within Le District is this little French jewel designed to resemble a Parisian apartment—hence its name. In fact, a meal at the charming L'Appart feels less like coming to a restaurant and more like attending a dinner party, albeit one with potentially 28 guests. Thus, you’re handed a drink as soon as you walk through the doors and are thereafter introduced to the affable chef, Nicolas Abello. At this point you’ll realize it’s worth making the effort to buy into the whole conceit; otherwise the inherent awkwardness of the whole situation could make you want to run for the hills. It helps that the service staff here is genuinely warm and eager to please. From then on, things settle down into a more recognizable format. Their set menu kicks off with ""Nico's snacks"" that are artistic little creations to get your tastebuds warmed up. These could include a succulent mouthful of brandade or a crisp cone of creamy ricotta and sweet fig. Then it's into the lineup of French dishes made using all manner of modern techniques; flavors are well-defined and marry well, and the dishes are unapologetically rich-in this apartment ""cream"" is certainly not a dirty word."
"L'Artusi","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.lartusi.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This polished, airy West Village charmer is a magnet for beautiful people-or maybe it's just that everyone looks gorgeous in L'Artusi's romantically lit room, divvied up into three dining options and a quiet mezzanine, alongside its more traditional dining area. A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes, spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta. Polish that off with a drink from their generous list of aperitivi or fantastic selection of wines by the glass, and you'll be feeling quite beautiful yourself by dinner's end."
"Suzuki","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.suzukinyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","In typical Japanese fashion, Suzuki nails minimalist chic. The simple elegance doesn't end with its high design. Also noticeably uncluttered is the dining room, so if you're looking for a ""scene,"" venture elsewhere. The carte here spins to the season and is a study in fine-dining. Artful creations include a vegetarian variety, but those in the know may pass on that menu, order Chef Takashi Yamamoto's version of kaiseki, and let him show off his skills. Wanmori impresses with its exceptional consommé and delicate dumpling; top-quality sashimi is nicely plated; and baby ayu tempura elevates the Saikyo miso-marinated grilled rainbow trout. Kurobuta pork belly served Yamato-style with eggplant and red paprika is delicious despite its less-than-dazzling appearance."
"Sutton Inn","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.suttoninnrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This charming American bistro flies a bit under the radar, but has all the things you'd want in a neighborhood restaurant. It's exceptionally quaint and cozy; the guests are friendly and often local; and the vibe is perfectly laid-back. And while the space is decidedly unflashy, the refined dishes showcase a delicious interplay between quality ingredients and the notable talents of the kitchen. Kick things off with a mouthwatering bowl of chilled corn soup, served sweet and creamy and garnished with roasted poblano peppers, Gouda, pico de gallo, and fresh cilantro. Then move on to a lovely fillet of bluefish, roasted to crispy-outside-and-tender-inside perfection, and served over nutty wild rice with snap pea slivers and a mild green curry emulsion."
"SushiAnn","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushiann.net","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Step through the serene, bamboo-filled entrance and into this dedicated sushi den. The mood is respectfully formal yet friendly, thanks to the focused kitchen staff who are happily interacting with guests. Just arrive with a sense of what (and how much) you'd like to eat and insist upon the omakase. Let the day's catch dictate your meal and take a seat at the counter, where only the glassed-in display of fish and mollusks separates you from this team of skilled, disciplined chefs. The omakase may be wildly varied depending on the day (and your chef), but high standards are always maintained and each morsel is treated with integrity. A final sashimi course may reveal a glistening array of mild giant clam, firm tai, and tuna that melts in the mouth."
"Sushi Zo","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushizo.us","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","This LA import has sushi that rivals the best in New York but is served with a laid-back vibe that is a welcomed change of pace. Sushi Zo is nonetheless ambitious, serving superlative fish and seafood that is pristine, delicious, and well beyond reproach. The petite space is serene and showcases a particularly lovely mix of blonde wood and exposed brick, decorated with little more than birch branches. Their nightly omakase menu has only two turns at the counter as well as the handful of tables, so plan well in advance if you want to approach this multi-course feast. Begin with a plump Kumamoto oyster served with a slightly sweet ponzu sauce and lime zest in the company of spectacular sashimi. Their exquisite nigiri-with bright flavors and skilled torch work-is sure to be the highlight of your meal thanks to halibut with lemon and sea salt, belt fish with wasabi, and shima aji with yuzu juice. Each long slice of perfectly fresh fish drapes off the delicate shari; those generous proportions belie Sushi Zo's origins as a California-based sushi-ya that is unafraid to flout tradition. Finish with a delicate and palate-cleansing fish-bone consommé and sphere of house mochi."
"Sushi Yasuda","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushiyasuda.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","There is a Spartan appearance to this sushi temple, where honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest feature. Reservations require confirmation and punctuality, but to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Avoid the tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) and request a seat at the sleek counter—it’s where the magic happens. Your experience here depends entirely on the soft-spoken, attentive, and very focused itamae working before you, as his signature style will guide your meal. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives a wide variety of fish that has just been cut, formed and dressed moments before it is eaten. The kitchen lives up to its hype by ignoring new wave trends in favor of serving classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi. Every item is handled with the utmost care, especially the progression of sashimi highlighting the ample textures of mackerel, tuna, and salmon. Outstanding clams and scallops are seasoned with a touch of lemon and sea salt flakes to enhance their natural taste; while nigiri featuring Maine and Japanese uni tastings underscore the subtle differences in flavor."
"Sushi Yasaka","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sushiyasaka.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There are no decorative distractions at this efficient if spare sushi-ya located a few steps below street level. The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, a well-lit counter in the rear, and is warmed-up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value omakase. Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course omakase might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth brimming with scallions, seaweed, and a fish cake."
"Sushi of Gari","","Over 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sushiofgari.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There is a great deal that appears simple here, but there is much more that is not. The room, itself, is a minimally decorated space of pale wood, bright lights, and a few ikebana arrangements that it almost feels sterile. However, few seem to take note. It is no secret that when you make a reservation here, request the counter and go for the omakase, because precise plating, skilled knife work, and renowned sushi is where everyone's attention remains. The kitchen's skill shines with dishes that showcase their unique creativity. Signature dishes include lean, ruby-red slices of tuna wrapped around creamy tofu dressed with spicy sesame oil, or salmon nigiri with piping hot sautéed tomato. Dining here requires advance planning, but they also offer takeout."
"Sushi Nakazawa","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushinakazawa.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sushi lovers can breathe a sigh of relief-after an oh-so-brief closing, beloved Sushi Nakazawa has emerged sexier, more spacious and more delicious than ever. Even better? It's much easier to ""score"" a seat now. Updates include an elegant new lounge where a limited selection of sushi is served à la carte, accompanied by some inventive spins on their extensive wine, beer and sake list. Whether you land in the main dining room or the lounge, the gorgeous fish on offer is of outstanding quality. Indulge in a truly luxurious flight of creamy uni hailing from Maine, Santa Barbara, and Hokkaido; scallop spiked with bold, bright citrusy notes and wrapped in excellent nori; or a perfectly restrained slice of Atlantic bluefin, barely kissed with soy sauce."
"Sushi Katsuei","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sushikatsuei.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sushi Katsuei does Park Slope proud with some of the borough's best sushi, expertly seasoned and sliced. In fact, this Brooklyn spot is now staking its claim in Manhattan with an outpost in the West Village. Populated with locals and their kids, the mood is upbeat and warm, as regulars crowd the counter for the best seats. The chefs know their stuff and they showcase quality fish, but the menu is equally well suited to those who just want a spicy tuna roll or a cooked dish. Stray from the pedestrian and surrender to the omakase, where you will be rewarded with a parade of remarkably fresh sushi and sashimi. Tempura dishes are just as enticing, especially the naturally sweet roasted pumpkin. The prices are fantastic for such high quality food."
"Sushi Ishikawa","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ishikawanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","After honing his skills at the New York outpost of O Ya, Chef Don Pham has made his way to this quiet residential stretch of the Upper East Side, where he delivers a profoundly solid and wallet-friendly omakase each night. The new space is minimalist and very pleasant, largely thanks to the chef's charming presence, as he informs counter guests of the provenance of each morsel of fish-most often sourced from Japan. Meals arrive primarily as a parade of nigiri, presented one piece at a time on a ceramic slab with chopped bits of pickled ginger. Highlights may reveal torched barracuda or shima-aji with a spicy dab of chilies. That procession may be broken up with delicious small plates, such as smoked bonito with shaved summer truffles and ponzu sauce."
"Sushi Inoue","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushiinoue.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","For truly outstanding sushi, head to the heart of Harlem, where Chef Shinichi Inoue—formerly of Sushi Azabu—presides over this discreet and unexpected addition to the neighborhood. Inside the small establishment, bamboo blinds obscuring the scene outside, combined with hushed and genuine hospitality produce a sense of calm and refinement. The Nagasaki-born chef works behind a display of sparkling fillets and a dark counter arranged with 14 washi placemats and sets of lacquered chopsticks. It is here that a concise list of omakase options is prepared increasing in price with the additions of tempura, sashimi and an uni tasting. Chef Inoue personally looks after every detail of the meal-from the blended soy sauce to the house miso recipe. Pickled ginger placed on your tray ushers in the expertly crafted nigiri, and while the grated wasabi root that sparks most pieces can be a bit aggressive at times, the procession is rather delightful. Highlights include a bite of buttery shima aji from Kyushu island; shiro ika dressed with salt and sudachi; soy-marinated tuna with mustard and toasted sesame seeds; and fatty tuna from Boston-one of the rare pieces not from Japanese waters."
"Sushi Ginza Onodera","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","https://onodera-group.com/en/","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","Japanese cuisine is often prone to reinterpretation so traditionalists, albeit fiscally unencumbered ones, will like this Edomae sushi restaurant. It certainly looks quite grand in its midtown spot—a location that makes sense as Fifth Avenue and Ginza are pretty similar places. The restaurant is also impressive inside, thanks largely to the 16 seater L-shaped cypress counter that’s the focus of the room. The only real decision you need to make is how many pieces of nigiri you want. Once you’ve done that and chosen some sake, sit back and watch the chefs make each one with quick, deft movements before placing them individually in front of you. Much of the fish is flown in from Tokyo’s Tsukiji market while the white rice is from Niigata Prefecture and is seasoned with two types of red vinegar, hence its dark hue. It’s cooked firm, so that each grain is clearly discernible in the mouth—a feature of great sushi. The nigiri follows the traditional path of starting with lighter fish and progressing through to stronger flavors, with each piece lightly brushed with nikiri. Highlights include salmon roe, succulent aji (horse mackerel) and squid, which comes dressed with a little Hokkaido uni."
"Sushi Dojo","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sushidojonyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sushi Dojo is a snug den where the 14-seat counter and smattering of tables stay decidedly packed with Japanese food hunters-in-the-know. In fact, this minimally decorated space still feels a bit cult-like, with diners waiting patiently outside for a chance just to sample the goods. The chef's choice menu is highly recommended, offering great value for this level of skill and quality. With much of it ariving straight from Japan, the fish is pristine and ultra-seasonal. Counter customers are locked into the omakase (and won't regret it), but diners can also opt for à la carte. Either way, expect the likes of red snapper, fried shrimp head, yellowtail from Australia, blue fin from Greece, buttery Hokkaido scallop, and even a dollop of creamy uni."
"Sushi Daizen","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sushidaizen.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The staff is upbeat, and the room is attractively minimal in design, but what really stands out here is the adoration of this little sushi-ya’s devoted clientele. The mood is light and engaging as everyone digs into their omakase, with options to add sashimi or a small list of à la carte pieces. Start your meal with a cool appetizer of enoki mushrooms in soy and dashi broth, or crisp green beans over creamy tofu. A knob of pickled ginger freshly sliced before your eyes signals the beginning of your sushi course, a progression of neatly trimmed, hand-formed morsels of fish. Highlights include excellent poached tiger shrimp, Santa Barbara sea urchin, and kawa kawa from Japan. A fatty tuna hand roll at the end of your meal serves a perfect finale."
"Sushi Amane","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.mifune-restaurant.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Straight from his work at Tokyo's revered Sushi Saito, Chef Shion Uino has arrived in New York to bring a rare level of skill and experience to Sushi Amane. Do not be misled by the chef’s young age—he began his sushi training at 18, which makes him an old timer compared to this cool and serene newcomer of a restaurant. The handful of tables offer pleasant seating for groups, but the eight-seat sushi counter is the place to sit, right in view of a workspace displaying grated wasabi root and that night’s selection from the sea. The chef’s expert trimming and slicing is only interrupted by an assistant occasionally replenishing warm bowls of vinegar-seasoned rice. Cooked bites such as steamed abalone or a clam consommé that tastes of the ocean may be lovely diversions, but the tasting of Hokkaido and Kyushu uni is otherworldly. Still, the real point of dining here is the sushi. Each morsel is beautifully crafted and neither receives nor requires much embellishment. The procession of astoundingly fresh fish may move from gently scored flounder or ruby-red Bluefin tuna to carefully prepared squid and much more. Meals end on a high note with a unique take on tamago that is dense, custardy, and sweet."
"Supper","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.supperrestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This is the kind of fuss-free Italian cooking that true New Yorkers keep in regular rotation. The dark, quirky interior spreads across multiple rooms for a relaxed setting. There is no better salvo to this style of dining than their complimentary beans soaked in olive oil with chilies, garlic, and parsley. Follow with thick, shareable portions of bruschetta, slathered with chicken liver and bits of sea salt. Their ""extraordinary platter of vegetables"" is just that, and serves as a reminder that few cuisines can work such wonders with roasted fennel, sautéed escarole, grilled asparagus, and more. Veal Milanese is just as delicious as those fancy midtown joints, but half the price. The adjacent wine bar is a worthy stop to sip from an incredible list."
"Spotted Pig","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.thespottedpig.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","It's impossible to tell if the famously talented April Bloomfield ever imagined the massive draw her restaurant would have, but years ago, when Spotted Pig sashayed its way into the West Village, NY'ers were more than ready to fall in love with the gastropub. However, it is the cooking that has been the main draw here-even if you are teetering on a wooden stool or knocking elbows with pencil-thin hipsters in this cozy, bi-level space. Outstanding staples like burgers, pan-seared mackerel, or gnudi-ricotta ""gnocchi"" laced with brown butter, sage and parmesan-have a cultish following; while creamy burrata spread on sourdough with fava and mint, as well as a perfectly roasted poussin served with Sherry vinegar and grilled ramps are favorites for good reason."
"Sunday in Brooklyn","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sundayinbrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","With all due respect to Monday through Saturday, the best day may be Sunday in Brooklyn. That is if grooving to old-school hip hop with a well-made cocktail in one hand and freshly baked sourdough slathered with beer butter in another is your kind of thing. This café is free of that formulaic hipster décor and instead flaunts a rustic Med villa-meets-ski cabin look. Those warm, gooey sticky buns are sinfully delicious and no one skips the breads. The kitchen also deserves praise for brunch, which is on everyone's mind. However, it's far from the only game here, where the chef curries favor with diners all day long. A $4 Dark and Stormy can be a fine tonic against inclement weather. Don't miss the market for goodies like smoked fish and irresistible pastries."
"Sottocasa","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sottocasanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you'll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining. The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti, and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, bianche or rosse (with-hurrah!-a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives, and hot sopressata."
"Speedy Romeo","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.speedyromeo.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Named for a racehorse and just as focused and quick, Speedy Romeo is in for a successful run. Part tavern, part roadside grill, its kitschy décor and modern touches transform this former automotive shop into a surprisingly attractive spot. The owner benefited from years at Jean-Georges' empire, and that intelligence and experience is conveyed through the smart accents and whimsical menu that begins with Italian ingredients. Look to the wood-burning oven for smoky, meaty artichoke halves topped with lemon aïoli, sourdough crumbs, mint, and peppery arugula. Take a chance on the non-traditional but utterly fantastic pizza combinations, such as the St. Louis, layering a proper crust with meats, pickled chillies, and Midwestern Provel cheese."
"Somtum Der","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.somtumder.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Tucked along the fringes of Alphabet City, a little taste of authentic Isaan Thai awaits. Originally based out of Bangkok, the New York outpost of Somtum Der offers a cozy little enclave for the East Village set, stylishly accented with bright pops of red, and a welcome glimpse of the kitchen's somtum station. There, you'll spy large glass jars of peanuts, dried red chilies, and spices-the contents of which are ground by mortar and pestle to produce what some claim is the city's best green papaya salad. Order big here, for the portions aren't massive and the food is so terrific you'll inevitably want more. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch, spice-wise, but you'll need to request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity."
"Soba-Ya","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sobaya-nyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","There's a ton of Japanese restaurants that line this stretch of the East Village, so why Soba-Ya? Why not Soba-Ya, its ultra-dedicated patrons would argue-for the buckwheat soba as well as the hearty udon on tap here are consistently off-the-charts good. Co-owner and mini-mogul, Bon Yagi, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments. And here he employs that traditional aesthetic to sweet perfection; along with a graceful, but simply appointed dining space; and quiet, well-timed service. A meal might begin with uni and grated mountain yam, kissed with wasabi and crispy, toasted nori. Then transition to a seasonal noodle dish like warm soba mingled with plump, pickled oysters, mountain yam, cilantro and tempura root vegetables."
"Soba Totto","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sobatotto.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's a jam-packed lunchtime operation here at Soba Totto, where business folks gather and quickly fill the popular space. As the name suggests, everyone arrives in droves for the tasty homemade soba. Dinnertime brings a mellower vibe, and a crowd of beer- and sake-sipping patrons ordering tasty plates of spicy fried chicken and yakitori galore. Midday features several varieties of lunch sets. Tasty appetizers may unveil a salad of assorted pickles and simmered daikon in a sweet ginger dressing. Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful noodles in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam, and egg."
"Sip Sak","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sip-sak.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Tucked inside a charming, bistro-like setting with pressed-tin ceilings and cool white marble-top tables, this neighborhood favorite just keeps getting better with age. Owner Orhan Yegen runs a tight ship, directing his staff and kitchen as they entice diners with a meze of citrusy olives, delicious hummus, garlicky cacik, and creamy tarama. Kick things off with a starter of plump shrimp cooked in a downright addictive garlic and parsley sauce; or tuck into an equally earthy Greek salad with a Turkish twist featuring pickled cabbage, crumbled feta, and a poached artichoke heart filled with dilled fava beans. For dinner, skip the seafood and opt for fragrant and hearty lamb meatballs, served over rice pilaf with a grilled tomato and pile of mixed greens."
"Shuko","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.shukonyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Jimmy Lau and Nick Kim, both Masa alumni, have created a high-end sushi bar for a young and eager crowd. They’ve nailed the ultra-discreet façade—anyone who’s eaten out in Tokyo will know the feeling of walking past a place a couple of times before finding its door. The centerpiece of the windowless room is the three-sided counter fashioned out of white ash—it’s a thing of beauty which you’ll find unable to resist stroking every now and again. Drinks aside, you have just one choice to make-to have the omakase or the marginally more expensive kaiseki. Even for Edomae-style sushi, the size is quite diminutive, with the best pieces being those that push a little at the boundaries. The rice could be better but there's no doubting the quality of the fish."
"Schilling","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.schillingnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If anyone's willing to set up shop in unlikely places, it's the talented Eduard Frauneder, who has quietly tucked his newest creation into the Financial District. The 70-seat restaurant, designed by Florian Altenburg, features a striking glass-panel garage door and sleek interior with exposed barn wood and steel columns that make use of the building's original features. In the back, a U-shaped bar pours some terrific Viennese-inspired cocktails. At Schilling, Frauneder's contemporary take on Austrian cooking hints at sunnier climes, as in wild mushroom ravioli with sorrel sauce, baby shiitake, and courgette fondant. Don't miss tender, perfectly braised lamb shoulder set over pistachio crumble, couscous, harissa, and zippy mustard greens to cut the richness."
"Secchu Yokota","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.secchuyokota.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","New York may be a hotbed of great Japanese food, but Secchu Yokota adds a bit of frill and fun to the dining scene with its very personal take on tempura. The diminutive room feels warm, as the handful of guests are seated directly in front of the working chefs and fully open kitchen. The traditional omakase moves through courses that highlight the chef's training in both Eastern and Western kitchens. To begin, an appetizer may showcase French technique in a sublime English pea soup with jalapeño oil and fennel. Japanese tradition guides the preparation of each delicately fried morsel of seasonal tempura, from shrimp to mushroom caps. Wonderful layers of flavor twirl through the green tea soba noodles with duck breast, finished tableside with a cool dashi."
"Sevilla","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sevillarestaurantandbar.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Yellowed menus that haven't changed in decades make this old-school Spanish stalwart seem like a relic. Still, no one comes here to be surprised. Rather, they are plowing through their favorite renditions of paella, ranging from vegetable to seafood with chicken and chorizo. The paella Valenciana also adds clams, mussels, and lobster claws. Prices are low, portions are large, and lively crowds are always happy. Dishes are made to order, so if that arroz con pollo takes 30 minutes to get to your table, know that it will be worthy of the wait. It arrives as a massive amount of saffron-tinged rice and tender bone-in chicken dotted with green onions, pepper strips, chorizo, peas, and lots of garlic. Come dessert, you cannot go wrong with the flan."
"Satsuki","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.suzukinyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","The unique nature of this marvel begins with its layout. Descend to the lower level and first encounter the opulent Three Pillars bar. Then comes the elegant Suzuki dining room, and finally reach your goal at Satsuki. This omakase-only counter seats no more than ten guests in an utterly tranquil shrine dedicated to upscale Japanese cuisine. Meals begin with the presentation of a wooden box, displaying the seafood that will soon become your meal. Each component of this sushi is prepared with paramount care, right down to the blend of vinegars that season the rice. The selection of fish may sound familiar—shrimp, cuts of tuna, uni—but demonstrate the careful craftsmanship of Chef Toshio Suzuki, who spent an age honing his skills at Sushi Zen. A trio of sashimi is served with three distinct sauces for dipping. This is followed by a simmered dish, like braised monkfish liver with sesame salt. When the parade of sushi arrives, each morsel strives to outdo the last. Meals culminate as the chefs coax layers of flavor from petals of Hokkaido uni with a hint of wasabi, wonderfully mild needlefish, and fatty tuna from Spain. Handrolls in crisp nori make for a superb conclusion."
"Saraghina","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.saraghinabrooklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","If you build it, they will come: and sure enough, from the moment Saraghina opened its doors to a just-burgeoning Bed-Stuy, diners have flooded this cool, multi-room restaurant decorated in garage-sale knickknacks, old butcher signs, and marmalade jars. It's downright adorable. But, it's the delicious food that fills these seats. Still best known for their irresistible pizzas, blistered to puffy perfection, the menu offers all kinds of heavenly dishes not to miss, like the fried calamari and shrimp, served with tangy lemon and aïoli; or a wood fire-roasted side of cauliflower mixed with creamy mascarpone, tart labneh cheese, and Marcona almonds. Just around the corner, at 433 Halsey, a sister bakery serves up fresh pastries and a mean espresso all day."
"Sauvage","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.sauvageny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sauvage means ""wild and natural"" in French, and that's a perfectly apt description for this handsome restaurant with a thoughtful list of naturalist wines. Select one of the organic, biodynamic offerings; then sit back, relax and take in the leather booths, walnut bar, hand-blown glass chandeliers and tropical plants. But enough about drinks and décor, because the kitchen happens to be whipping up dishes that absolutely thrill. Highlights include roasted cauliflower served with anchovy and peppercorn; or even Japanese fingerlings dressed with beef fat-vinaigrette. Pooled in a vinegar swirl, crispy sweetbreads are delivered with mushrooms and watercress. Pan-seared rabbit with turnip purée and a mustard seed-honey ""broth"" makes for a hearty and fragrant finale."
"San Matteo","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.sanmatteopanuozzo.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This tiny pizzeria has made a big splash with its panuozzo, a regional specialty hailing from Campania that's a cross between a calzone and panino. The puffy plank of tender, salted dough emerges from San Matteo's hand-built, wood-fired oven crusty and smoke-infused before being sliced and stuffed with first-rate ingredients (highlights include the ortolano's fresh, house-made mozzarella, grilled eggplant, roasted sweet peppers, and baby arugula). The room is graciously attended to and perpetually crowded with neighborhood folks stuffing their faces. In addition to the appetizing house signature, other favorites feature fresh salads such as escarole with Gaeta olives, capers, and gorgonzola; Neapolitan-style pizza; or the day's special baked pasta."

It's hard to say when it comes to this hot spot, which caters to hockey players, Russian intelligentsia, and vodka aficionados alike. Our bets are on that beautiful vodka selection, available in all kinds of flavors, qualities, and sizes (shot, carafe, or bottle). Nestled into the bustling Theater District, Russian Samovar is both quirky and elegant-with low lighting, glass panels, and musicians tickling the piano and violin. The staff is attentive, sweet, and can walk you through delicious fare like fresh salmon-caviar blini, prepared tableside; pelmeni, tender veal dumplings served with sour cream and honey mustard; or milk-cured Baltic herring, paired with pickled onions, potatoes, and carrots."

Even if the lip-smacking tapas menu didn't draw customers in droves, a sexy décor dressed with oodles of fresh roses and the warm glow of candlelight would do the trick. A slender hallway opens up into a narrow dining hall featuring dark walls; tufted velvet banquettes; and a backyard dining area topped by a retractable roof. The Spanish cuisine, skillfully rendered by chef and San Sebastian native, Luis Bollo, arrives as intricate tapas or hearty large plates, depending on your appetite. Tuck into arroz brut a la plancha, a tender, griddled cake of short grain brown rice, studded with savory merguez, peas, and raisins; or baked fideuà sauced with squid ink and topped with shaved sepia, garlicky aïoli and watercress sprouts."

You're in his hands for the evening as he offers just two omakase menus-the difference being that the more expensive one comes with an added sashimi course. The chef sticks to a fairly traditional Edomae style and uses a variety of sources for his fish. Uni may be from Hokkaido but the shrimp is from Canada; tuna from Spain; salmon from Scotland; and the rice hails from California. The menus are good value as they include appetizers, around ten pieces of sushi, chawanmushi, red miso soup and dessert. If, for some bizarre reason, you're still not sated then go next door to the chef's ramen shop, Nishida Sho-ten."

Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with everything-bagel chips. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and ""eggs Benny"" with salmon, spinach, and challah never fails to peg a bruncher."

The menu is arranged into a collection of interesting, izakaya-style, shared plates, but there is a $65 tasting menu available as well for those with serious appetites. Dishes often blend Japanese technique with non-traditional ingredients like radicchio or parmesan.

Inside, the theme continues with walls constructed of concrete blocks shaped like flour sacks. Lunchtime sandwiches showcase their beloved array of house-baked breads, like whole wheat pain au lait grilled with cheddar and pickled peppers, or falafel-inspired broccoli fritters swaddled in a warm pita with shots of harissa and walnut-yogurt sauce. Come dinnertime, try impressive house-made pastas or the crowd-pleasing fish of the day, like a monkfish fillet that is seared golden and buttery inside."

The classic pie balances a crispy, cracker-thin crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-browned spots of salty, melting mozzarella. And the handmade pastas are highly recommended-you can't go wrong with a bowl of chewy chittara and its three hefty and hearty meatballs. Half portions allow diners to enjoy more of the favorable cooking here, and gluten-free pasta and pizza ensures everyone can enjoy it."
"Rouge Tomate","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.rougetomatechelsea.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Located in a cozy brownstone (and previous home to the Gracie family, of Gracie Mansion), Rouge Tomate has reopened without missing a single beat. This iteration is warmer and less clinical—in a soulful space that is a fraction of its former footprint. Its philosophy of sustainability manifests in an appealing design that incorporates wood salvaged from hurricane Sandy devastation, with bright red votives as if to conjure the original spot. Perhaps the most important continuation is this kitchen’s dedication to S.P.E. (<I>Sanitas Per Escam</I>) or “health through food.” Of course, this translates as cooking that optimizes nutrition, sustainability, and a diner’s well-being, while also remaining thoroughly delicious. The result is a menu of ethically raised meats, seasonal produce, and minimal dairy to pair with mocktails, fresh juices, biodynamic wines, and so much more. This may sound steeped in principles, but rest assured as everything churned out of the kitchen is downright delicious. High points include expertly prepared skate with snail ragout over braised greens, as well as a divine lemongrass parfait topped with mango sorbet, kiwi, and praline crumbles."
"Roberto's","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.roberto089.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","You can't miss this storied Italian-American favorite whose design falls somewhere between a cozy farmhouse and Mediterranean villa. In fact, Roberto's bright coral façade lets you know right away there's allegria to be had at this hopping respite. This space is as ideal for big groups as it is for romantic evenings. Inside, you'll find a cozy, carved-wood bar and roomy farmhouse tables lit by candlelight. In addition to the regular menu (think wonderful, fun shapes of pasta al cartoccio as well as other classic entrées like grilled pork chop), it's always worth a look at the chef's delicious daily specials. Of course, save the best for last as evidenced by the sbriciolata crumb cake with amaretto, chunks of chocolate, ricotta and almonds."
"Ristorante Morini","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.ristorantemorini.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Altamarea Group's prime Madison Avenue corner boasts a lively street-level lounge and second story window-lined dining room where even children in tow are properly attired for lunch. Despite the high-rent address, Ristorante Morini offers an economical lunch prix-fixe, as well as a family-style Sunday supper. Slick Italian dining is the draw here, as demonstrated by the likes of bocconcini (chicken meatballs) infused with eggplant and fennel seed, baked with tomato sauce, and garnished with basil, breadcrumbs and more eggplant. Spaghetti vongole tossed with steamed clams, leeks, and a white wine sauce flaunts luxurious texture from a swirl of butter; while desserts like vanilla bean gelato dressed with a shot of espresso and amaro are nothing short of luxurious."
"Roberta's","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.robertaspizza.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Entering through this (now) iconic red door is like a trip through the looking glass and into Bushwick's foodie wonderland. The city's love affair with Roberta's seems stronger each year, and for good reason. Everything from the industrial space to the underground Bohemian vibe epitomizes Brooklyn-chic. A new takeaway option has been added to the compound, so when the wait for a table is too long, snag a porchetta sandwich to-go. Queens native Carlo Mirarchi leads a talented kitchen and its menu of beautifully prepared pasta, vegetables, and more. Many diners stick to the creatively named, less than purely Italian pizza, like the Speckenwolf, with freshly dried oregano, house-made mozzarella, thinly sliced speck, red onion, and roasted cremini mushrooms."
"Ribalta","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ribaltapizzarestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","It all starts with the dough. That said, Ribalta's mother version apparently started nearly a century ago and has been kept alive to feed the masses since. Today, it rises for 72 hours before being baked into a crust that is so light and digestible that you might be tempted to go for a second, very authentic Margherita, topped with that perfect balance of tomato sauce, mozzarella, olive oil, and basil. Pasta dishes are just as strong, so sample a duo of wonderfully tender gnocchi, thickly dressed in pesto or an excellent penne rigate con ragù Napolitano loaded with ground pork and beef. The food may be substantial, but the space feels like La Grande Mela thanks to red leather banquettes, creatively tiled white walls, and planks suspended from the lofty ceiling."
"Rider","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.riderbklyn.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Some may think this hip, bi-level eatery is an offshoot of the Brooklyn performance space National Sawdust, but in fact Rider vies for top billing. Downstairs, you'll find an industrial vibe outfitted with concrete flooring, exposed brick walls, and comfy banquettes; upstairs is polished, low-lit and moodier. Patrick Connolly has put together an exciting menu designed for sharing, with a refreshing focus on vegetables. The execution and flavors transcend the trendiness of the space, offering unfussy, timeless dishes that may be considered small plates, but are generously portioned. Try gemelli bathed in mushroom ragù with crisp breadcrumbs, or grilled mortadella on sourdough with ricotta, toasted sunflower seeds and a nasturtium ""pesto."""
"Red Rooster","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.redroosterharlem.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","So many things make Red Rooster special, not the least of which is Chef Marcus Samuelsson, whose head-spinning achievements include inventive world-renowned cooking, penning cookbooks, and bringing the New Harlem Renaissance to Lenox Avenue. Downstairs, find live music at Ginny's Supper Club. Up front, The Nook serves sweets and sandwiches to-go. And in the center, Red Rooster celebrates Harlem, the African-American diaspora, and great food. Start with a brilliantly simple wedge of crumbly and buttery corn bread. Then, move on to the likes of highly spiced and ""dirty"" basmati rice with sweet shrimp and swirls of lemon aïoli; or try their interpretation of South African ""bunny chow"" served as lamb stew on a sesame bun with a fried egg and fresh ricotta."
"Raoul's","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.raouls.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's the nature of all great cities to constantly change but that doesn't mean severing ties to the past. Raoul's has been around since the '70s-which alone qualifies it as an ""institution""-but this is no museum piece living on past glories. Wander in on any given night and you'll see a crowd of all ages united in their fondness for French food and their ability to enjoy themselves. The menu wouldn't necessarily entice the passer-by on content alone but the kitchen has a surprisingly delicate touch that raises dishes above the ordinary, whether that's tender octopus with chickpea purée or succulent rack of lamb with oyster mushrooms. In the stampede to find all that is new, shiny and hot we shouldn't ignore those whose sin is mere longevity."
"Racines NY","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.racinesny.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The American outpost of this popular Parisian original cuts an elegant figure, with its wide marble bar and pristine flower arrangements. Throw in romantic low lighting, brick-lined walls and a tony TriBeCa address-and you have quite the operation. The service can be a bit off-putting, which is a shame because Racines NY has an ace, even affordable, wine list that bears discussion and recommendations. As for the food, you'll pay for all that sexy ambience a little more than the cuisine currently merits-but certain dishes, like a rich chicken liver mousse served with grilled breads, make for an elegant bar snack. Paired with one of those excellent wines by the glass and a seat at that handsome bar, this is a recipe for a glam night on the town."
"Prime Meats","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.frankspm.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Prime Meats stands tall and proud as a true original and local gem for German eats set to American beats. The booths in front are bright and snug, while bentwood chairs and net curtains tied into a knot add to that brasserie feel. A warm vibe and cheery servers complete the picture. Hand-crafted sausages and burgers are all the rage here. Nibble away on homemade pretzels while perusing the lunch menu, which may be simple and sandwich-focused, but always showcases a gutsy edge. Bold flavors shine through in a creamy roasted squash soup; jagerwurst, a lightly charred, delicately smoky, and meaty sausage with red cabbage casserole; or Jen's German potato salad tossing waxy potato slices, chopped herbs, and thick bacon lardons in a pickled dressing."
"Quatorze Bis","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.quatorze.nyc","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Savoring a meal at this ever-charming bistro is like taking a break from the constant evolution that is life in New York City, where tastes change faster than you can tweet. The red-lacquer façade, claret-velvet banquettes, and sophisticated clientele are all much the same as when Quatorze Bis opened over 25 years ago. Though the ambience's timeless appeal is noteworthy, the traditional French cooking is their key to success. Frilly chicory, drizzled with hot bacon fat and red wine vinegar, and pocked with lardons, croutons, and shallots makes for a very hearty, très French salad. Seafood sausage is plump and studded with sweet red pepper and pine nuts. Daily specials keep the menu fresh, with dishes like striped bass served beside a creamy sorrel sauce."
"Purple Yam","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.purpleyamnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Owners Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan mix and match Southeast Asian dishes in such an appealing way at this neighborhood café, you'll have trouble figuring out what not to order. So follow the lead from the crowd-a smart, urbane mix of neighborhood types and savvy gourmands-and try a little bit of everything by sharing. Begin with pa jun, a delicious Korean scallion-and-shrimp pancake, and then move on to tender oxtail kare-kare, braised in peanut sauce and loaded with adobo, root vegetables and fermented fish paste. Other hits include the deliciously tangy and garlicky chicken adobo served with a refreshing green mango salad. The décor is simple and comfortable-a long, narrow dining room lined with art leads to a pretty backyard garden."
"Pylos","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.pylosrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Restaurateur Christos Valtzoglou has found the winning formula with this longstanding hideaway in the vibrant East Village. Pylos continues to sparkle as brightly as the Aegean Sea on a summer day. And, taking its name from the Greek translation of ""made from clay,"" this contemporary taverna also features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots, dressing up a room with rustic whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets. Pale-green stemware and stark white crockery are used to serve Greek wines and a menu of rustic home-style cooking. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; grilled marinated octopus is drizzled with balsamic reduction; and aginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic made here with artichokes."
"Prospect","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.prospectbk.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This Fort Greene standout offers delicious cooking and just so happens to be pretty cool, too. The beverage menu features riffs on the Negroni cocktail-one for instance substitutes reposado tequila for gin. Walls are lined with reclaimed planks of the Coney Island boardwalk, and genuinely hospitable service tames the packed house. Quality trumps quantity in the streamlined selection of product-driven creations. A neatly arranged row of silver dollar-sized kimchi pancakes, topped with tender strands of pulled pork make an enticing starter; while toothsome and tender house-made gnocchi is plated with snap peas, sautéed wild mushrooms, and sweet peas for a springtime treat. Finish with a contemporary take on banana cake enhanced with coconut cream foam."
"Porter House","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.porterhousenewyork.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Michael Lomonaco's flagship steakhouse offers unparalleled views of Central Park from its Time Warner Center perch. Here, tables are well-spaced and allow for fine dining, but look for those few intimate booths located in the front bar area-they make for a great escape on busy nights. The views certainly distinguish this handsome retreat from the pack, as do its carefully selected aged meats, quality fish, and expert sides. The kitchen puts out a tasty helping of sweet and spicy onion rings, buttermilk-battered and deep-fried in portions designed for linebackers. The beautifully marbled ribeye is aged for more than 45 days and would be delicious simply seared, though a chili rub adds an aggressive spice. Cool down with a lightly dressed purslane salad."
"Porsena","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.porsena.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Sophisticates of all ages flock to this neighborhood favorite to be enveloped by a warm, welcoming, and upbeat vibe. Euro-chic Porsena also boasts adept servers who can be seen strutting about with appetizing platters of aromatic food. As always, Chef Sara Jenkins proves herself to be a talent and a pro through presentations that are unfussy yet remain uniquely flavorful and always special. The menu rotates with the seasons, but standbys cannot be missed, like wild escarole salad with crisp leaves wilting in hot anchovy dressing; or huge rounds of anelloni tossed with spicy lamb sausage, peppery mustard greens, and breadcrumbs. If offered, get the lasagna expertly layering pasta sheets with a creamy béchamel and hearty veal-prosciutto ragù."
"Mill Basin Kosher Delicatessen","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.millbasindeli.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This middle-aged Brooklyn treasure is as old-school as it gets, and though it's a bit of a trek to Mill Basin, anyone looking for a true-blue Jewish deli won't think twice. Part deli counter, part artsy dining room, and part party hall, Mark Schachner's beloved spot serves up all the classics-from beef tongue sandwiches to gefilte fish. The wildly overstuffed sandwiches (all served with homemade pickles and coleslaw) are a home run, as in soft rye bread with pastrami, which is steamed not once but twice, leaving the meat juicy yet hardly fatty. Then dive into a heap of thin latke chips that are fried until golden-brown, crunchy on the outside, tender and chewy on the inside. Garnished with a mound of shiny caramelized onions, this is a sweet treat indeed."
"Shalom Japan","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.shalomjapannyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The curious moniker of this sweet spot refers to the backgrounds of its husband-and-wife team, Chefs Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi. Each has an impressive resume, and together the result is a unique labor of love. Nightly specials are displayed via a wall-mounted blackboard with small plates progressing to a handful of entrées. Monkfish hot pot features ankimo-enriched miso broth, ground shrimp balls, glass noodles, and a heap of fragrant herbs. The house-baked sake kasu challah with raisin butter is a highly recommended start. But, it may also turn up as toro toast smeared with scallion, wasabi cream cheese, and topped with finely chopped, smoked lean tuna belly. Still craving more? Experience it once again in the warm chocolate bread pudding."
"Pippali","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.pippalinyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Pippali offers a pleasing study on the myriad regional cuisines of India with an array of sensational curries, seafood dishes, and so much more. On-point service makes it a dream destination for date night or dinner with friends, and a muted color scheme in the sleek dining room provides an ideal backdrop for the kitchen's rout of boldly seasoned dishes. Standards are done right, but focus on their specialties for a unique perspective: melagu chemeen is a must-black pepper-rubbed Chilean sea bass simmered in a coconut-rich red chili curry; while Bombay dabeli unveils soft buns slathered with spicy mashed potatoes and crispy sev. Presentations are careful and unfussy, as found in baingan ka salan replete with peanut, sesame, and of course, more spice."
"Mile End","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.mileenddeli.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Boerum Hill's most bodacious deli serves up killer smoked meat and so much more. The tiny space gets lots of traffic, and those who can't find a seat along the counter or trio of communal tables can feast at home with takeout procured from the sidewalk window. Now for the food: a cured and charred brisket sandwich, stacked onto soft rye bread and smacked with mustard, is the stuff that dreams are made of. The smoked mackerel sandwich heaped with fennel slaw, avocado, and chunky tartar sauce is an eclectic take on the deli theme, which also reveals poutine and a Middle East-inspired falafel platter. Don't overlook the hand-rolled, wood-fired Montreal-style bagels from owner and Montreal native Noah Bernamoff's SoHo offshoot, Black Seed Bagel shop."
"Mifune","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.mifune-restaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Two superstar chefs arrive in one package with the elegant Mifune and omakase bar, Sushi Amane, which is located downstairs. Chef Hiroki Yoshitake presents delicious, contemporary Japanese cuisine here at Mifune, in a space featuring cement walls, blonde wood, and cozy backlighting. Alongside tempura, rice dishes, and other delightful entrées, this menu also offers a daily selection of sashimi. Tender smoked butterfish arrives with shaved radish rounds, nasturtium leaves, and a bright chimichurri-like sauce made from garlic, herbs and oil. Then, grilled chicken Yuan-style appears in a mini cast-iron skillet, brushed with an irresistible teriyaki-based sauce, and paired with knobs of tender, buttery potatoes, snap peas, and frizzled leeks."
"Nur","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.nurnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Tel Aviv's Meir Adoni has made a big splash with this culturally adroit restaurant. Its appetite-whetting cuisine is nuanced, with plenty of influences from the Middle East and Northern Africa. The menu spotlights recognizable dishes, but there are a number of unfamiliar newcomers that are a must. Start with fantastic breads, like the kubaneh with its toasty brown exterior and buttery, feathery interior. Palestinian hand-cut beef tartare is given a regional slant with sliced jalapeño and thick, tart yogurt and tahini. The Damascus qatayef are Syrian pancakes, almost like empanadas, filled with spiced lamb and nicely paired with an Aryan chaser, a light and refreshing Turkish yogurt drink. Even desserts, like that grapefruit Campari tart, are rave-worthy."
"Persepolis","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.persepolisnewyork.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Silky-smooth spreads, homemade yogurt, grilled meats, and fragrantly spiced stews have solidified Persepolis' reputation as one of the city's finest Persian restaurants. Linen-draped tables, spacious banquettes, and big windows facing Second Avenue fashion a look that inspires dressing up (or not). Service is always gracious, if at times earnest. The kitchen shines with its eggplant halim, a creamy, steaming roasted eggplant and onion dip with tender lentils and a dollop of yogurt on top. A kebab duo of saffron-tinged chicken and grilled beef are both succulent successes, served with basmati rice flecked with sour cherries. For dessert, try the tart-sweet Persian lemon ice studded with bits of rice noodles and doused in a deep red cherry syrup."
"Phil Am Kusina","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.philamkusina.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This charming dining room is located amidst a mostly residential neighborhood blocks away from busy Bay Street. The peaked-roof interior is brightened by skylights and pale peach walls, and the jovial vibe is amplified by genuinely gracious service. The menu offers a wide range of Filipino specialties including fried delights, noodle preparations, and simmered specialties like humba-a lusciously tender and fatty pork shank slow-simmered with soy sauce and pineapple. A side of crispy garlic-flecked rice is the perfect accompaniment to this sweet-and-salty treat. Inspired to whip something up in the comfort of your own kitchen? Just head across the street, where a long-standing Filipino grocery store shares the same name and family ownership."
"Prune","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.prunerestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This beloved neighborhood bistro won locals' hearts many moons ago, but Chef/owner/writer Gabrielle Hamilton's evolving talents keep them loyal. The tiny space packs a big punch-both for its sweet décor, which is surprisingly comfy to linger in, and for the kitchen's adventurous food. From greeting to check, Prune delivers the whole package-and consistently at that. Chef Hamilton's dishes are soulful and unpretentious. Savor tender stewed tripe Lyonnaise in a luxurious broth with carrots, celery and bay leaf; or perfectly poached chicken in a deliciously fatty and restorative stock with ham and oxtail. Guests can also watch the excitement unfold in the open kitchen while nursing a drink. Nightly specials, listed on the chalkboard, are always worth perusing."
"Pine Bar & Grill","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.pinebargrill.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Between this outpost and their popular sister restaurant, F & J Pine, the Bastone family has become a fixture on the Bronx restaurant scene, and their eateries thrive for good reason. Pine Bar & Grill, with its lovely muted yellow walls and black-and-white photos depicting the hometown borough, is, at heart, a red sauce joint of the old school variety. Yet the menu reflects the neighborhood's sizable Latin-American population in dishes like pernil and coconut shrimp paella; or a tender trio of empanadas. Don't miss the mouthwatering pizzette (especially good when Frankie's around); eggplant rollatini, stewed in a fragrant tomato sauce and drizzled with basil aïoli; or a juicy center-cut pork chop, finished with sweet and hot cherry peppers."
"Peter Luger","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.peterluger.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","More than just an icon of the New York dining scene—Peter Luger is an idolized classic. Run on wheels by a team of gloriously forthright waiters, this munificent paean to beef doesn’t just serve legendary steaks, it provides a side helping of history too. The wood paneling and beer-hall tables tell of family gatherings, friends united, deal making, success celebrated and stories swapped. It’s evocative and unforgettable. It’s also unapologetically old-school—computerization and credit cards remain fanciful futuristic concepts, so you’ll need to come with a few Benjamins tucked into your wallet. Start with a thick slice of bacon to get your taste buds up to speed before the steak arrives. These slabs of finely marbled Porterhouse are dry-aged in-house for around 28 days,  which means there’s tenderloin on one side of the bone and strip steak on the other. They are then broiled to perfection, sliced before being brought to the table, and served with their own sauce as well as a host of sides, which range from their version of German fried potatoes to creamed spinach. If you can still feel a pulse after that, there's always cheesecake served with their equally famous ""schlag"" to finish you off."
"Piccola Venezia","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.piccola-venezia.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This old-time idol deserves its landmark status as it has been going strong since opening in 1973. With Italian-American cooking so rampant in the city, it's wholly refreshing to happen upon a classic of such welcoming comfort. The décor is outdated, but white tablecloths are clean and crisp, and glasses gleam at the prospect of great wine varietals. With a trio of pasta, you needn't choose between fusi swirled in a grappa- mushroom- and Grana-sauce; squid ink taglierini; or maltagliati in a roasted tomato and basil sauce with a touch of cream. Spiedini alla Romana sees thick slabs of focaccia and mozzarella dredged and fried, served with an anchovy and caper sauce, and pork osso buco is of the falling-apart-tender variety-perfect with the velvety polenta."
"Pera","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.peranyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","For flavorful Turkish food infused with contemporary influence, Pera serves to please. Lunch does big business in this attractive dining room, layered in a chocolate-brown color scheme and packed with corporate types as well as visitors looking for a sleek place to sojourn mid-day. Acoustics can be loud, but with food so fine, you'll want to stay awhile. Dinner is more low-key but the menu always brims with simple, good quality, and slightly renovated plates like warm hummus with pastirma; lentil and bulgur tartare; or watermelon chunks tossed with salty feta, tomatoes, and olive oil. A forkful of their model and deliciously tender chicken adana with a side of addictively crispy fries has wide appeal and makes for a fitting feast-at all times."
"Periyali","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.periyali.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Relaxing and stylish for grown-ups, Periyali serves the kind of straightforward Greek cooking that remains blissfully unconcerned with trends. Think grilled octopus is boring? Think again, when presented with charcoal-grilled morsels, marinated for two days in red wine and finished with olive oil and parsley sauce. Salmon may not be native to Greece, but it gets its due respect here, wrapped with herbs and baked in phyllo, served alongside stewed okra. A puréed dish of fava kremidaki showcases a terrific blend of textures, colors, and flavors that is the heart and soul of this rustic kitchen. The dining room echoes the culinary theme with a suspended wall of shimmering decorative fish, abundant flower arrangements, and a back room flooded with natural light."
"Peasant","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.peasantnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Year after year, Peasant hits it out of the park. From the mouthwatering Italian food and the spot-on service, to the utterly charming osteria spirit, Frank DeCarlo's ode to the Italian gathering spot is the essence of easy excellence. The décor is charmingly rustic-picture whitewashed walls, bare wood tables, and a bustling wine bar downstairs. Kick things off with ricotta and otherworldly bread, fresh from the visible centerpiece hearth-which is the main method of cooking and sets this spot apart. But save room for house-made lasagna with braised rabbit ragù, creamy béchamel, and sweet root vegetables; tender razor clams in a fragrant white wine broth; succulent porchetta studded with garlic and rosemary; or stewed and chewy trippa alla Romana."
"Per Se","Three  Stars","Over 75 USD","Luxury in the traditional style. Our most delightful places","http://www.perseny.com","Three Stars • Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey","There is no missing this entrance on the Time Warner Center's fourth floor, where an outdoor patio bordered with potted plants and creeping ivy draw the eye to that iconic blue door. While the patio entry is indoors and the greenery is as faux as the idea that a garden can bloom next to a mall escalator, that Cal-French aesthetic invites with wondrous effect. Arrive in the dining room to face one of the city’s best views of Columbus Circle and Central Park. An upscale sense of calm—the kind that only money can buy—soaks the atmosphere inside. And dining here is so relaxing, whisper-quiet, and insanely expensive that it almost feels like a luxuriating day in the spa. A synchronized brigade of servers ensures that your every need is met. Chef Thomas Keller's cuisine is at once timeless and of the moment, raising the bar with meals that express artistry, seasonality, and sourcing that can seem hyperbolic-they know which Vermont cow gave the milk for your butter. Scallop-edged pierogies are so delicate that the purple tinge of braised cabbage shows from within, making an artful contrast to the surrounding Brussels sprout leaves, candied chestnut, and black truffle butter. Trios of dessert and house chocolates somehow get better with every meal."
"Pearl Oyster Bar","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.pearloysterbar.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's not hard to find a lobster roll in this city, and for that we can thank Rebecca Charles. This seafood institution-inspired by Charles' childhood summers spent in Maine-has been stuffing sweet lobster meat into split-top rolls since 1997. The two-room setting offers a choice: counter seating or table service. Wood furnishings and white walls are low-key; beachy memorabilia perks up the space. Start the meal by slurping your way through a classic chilled shellfish platter before tucking into that signature lobster roll, served alongside a tower of shoestring fries. The kitchen shines in daily specials, too, such as the grilled lobster served with corn pudding or pan-roasted wild bass. A hot fudge sundae is an appropriately nostalgic finish."
"Paulie Gee's","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.pauliegee.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Owner Paul Giannone, aka Paulie Gee, channeled a lifelong love of pizza into this charmingly delicious spot that feels as if it has been around forever. Rustic in appearance, the room's cool concrete and brick are warmed by the glow of the wood-burning oven imported from Naples. From here, Giannone and his son work their magic. The addictive crust is beguilingly moist and chewy, perfumed with smoke, and adroitly salted. Killer wood-fired pies dominate the menu with tempting combinations, excellent ingredients, and whimsical names. Offerings may include the Harry Belafontina-fontina, tomatoes, beefy meatballs, cremini mushrooms, and golden raisins. Vegans get equal respect here, with an added menu of vegan cheese and house-made vegan sausage."
"Patricia's","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.patriciasnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Much more than a neighborhood staple, Patricia's is an elegant restaurant committed to the convivial spirit of Southern Italy. Its seasonal fare is served in a gracious, brick-lined dining room among white tablecloths, chandeliers, and the warmth of a wood-burning oven. That brick oven churns out pleasing pizzas with lightly charred crusts, like the Regina simply adorned with buffalo mozzarella, torn basil, and a drizzle of excellent olive oil. Spaghetti Frank Sinatra is a stain-making bowl of slippery pasta loaded with shrimp, clams, olives, and capers in chunky tomato sauce. A light touch is seen in the grilled vegetables, topped with paper-thin cremini mushrooms. Don't miss the flaky and gently poached baccalà alla Livornese in a sharp, tangy sauce."
"Pasquale Jones","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.pasqualejones.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This stylish Italian charmer is a neighborhood restaurant fit for the modern age. Expect blistered Neapolitan-style pizzas straight from the wood oven; excellent handmade pastas; and vegetable-focused small plates. The space is snug, so try to nab reservations ahead-a challenging feat given its popularity. For a thoroughly 21st century bit of hospitality, request a text message when a counter seat opens. Plump diver scallops arrive seared to golden, sporting crisp fennel slivers, crushed hazelnut and juicy mandarin orange, while al dente rigatoni is tossed in a ricotta sauce dotted with pork sausage. For dessert, the seasonal option may feature lime curd topped with mascarpone ice cream, smoky meringue, and hazelnut cookie crumble."

The talented kitchen churns out tacos and enchiladas at a steady clip. You can't go wrong with an order of enchiladas San Miguel, a creative rendition that stuffs salsa roja-soaked tortillas with sautéed kale, roasted sweet cherry tomatoes, and creamy goat cheese. If you still have room, go for the chocolate flan with cinnamon ice cream."

The cuisine of Mexico City inspires Oso's menu with a concise, impressive offering of dishes like braised octopus tostada with mandarin salsa, guava- and chipotle-glazed ribs, as well as authentic tacos and antojitos.

"Oda House","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.odahouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","For a taste of something different, the inviting Oda House serves up intriguing specialties from Georgia. The vibe is simple and rustic with pumpkin-stained walls, exposed brick, and wood furnishings. Of course, this nation's proximity to Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Armenia results in a vibrant and diverse cuisine. A liberal use of spices, kebabs, khinkali (oversized meat-and-cheese dumplings), and khachapuri typify the kitchen's preparations. But, more classic dishes may reveal satsivi or boiled chicken served cool in a warmly spiced and seasoned walnut sauce, accompanied by gomi (hominy grits in a mini cauldron studded with rich and stretchy cheese). Balance out this hearty feast with a bright garden salad perfectly dressed with green ajika sauce."

Choose between two experiences: the long, well-worn bar (which may be rowdy with soccer fans) or the spacious dining room, reached through lovely arches. Seasoned servers know how to charm and keep customers patient, as dishes are made to order and can take time. Zoom in on anything with bacalhau here, a superior air-dried fish (not salt-cured) with excellent flavor and texture. The bacalhau à pescador sates with a stew of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, and potatoes. Another appealing soup is caldo verde full of meaty collards and smoky chorizo. Round out this elaborate feast with feijoada de mariscos, a slurry of white beans, seafood, and of course, more chorizo."

The efficient service is overseen by managers armed with authentic French accents and highly skilled in the art of flirting and flattery-the immaculately coiffured Orcéens may be a sophisticated bunch of customers but they expect a generous side order of Gallic charm to go with their classic French cuisine. All the favorites are here, from escargots to lobster bisque, quenelle Lyonnaise to île flottante, and the kitchen prepares them all with a healthy respect for tradition.

Dishes also highlight notable skill, especially as seen in the guinea hen roulade of beautifully cooked breast meat stuffed with ramp mousse and served alongside a bowl of thigh meat confit as well as black trumpet mushrooms à la Grecque. Finally, versatility is at the center of the delicate and shining chawanmushi topped with maitake mushrooms, smoked trout roe, and a shaving of bottarga."
"Oiji","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.oijinyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Oiji's modern take on Korean dining is a reminder that this food is so much more than barbecue. Devoid of smoky tabletops, the dining room is small and attractive, with an open kitchen to sneak peeks at the very talented chefs as they prepare a cuisine rooted in culinary tradition, but with creative and refined touches. Signature dishes do not disappoint, so try the wonderfully original pine-smoked mackerel, balancing the rich fish with citrus-soy sauce. Cold buckwheat noodles are a cool and contemporary nest of dark and chewy noodles topped with half of a slow-cooked egg, sesame seeds, and loads of scallions. And finally, gochujang chicken showcases nicely braised drumsticks with a variety of wintery vegetables in a spicy, tart, and garlicky sauce."
"Mexicosina","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.mexicosina.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The light-filled interior of this Mexican powerhouse sitting on a quiet corner is a busy amalgam of rustic artifacts, wolf taxidermy, and the Virgin Mother in all her glory with flowers and votives at her feet. And those huge jars of jamaica, horchata, and the agua fresca del dia are just as tasty and refreshing as they are decorative. If they have the tlayuda, order it. Its crunchy paper-thin base is smothered in a veritable fiesta of refried black beans, chicharrón, lettuce, queso Oaxaca, crema and much, much more. Other equally terrific specials have included chivo, a rich goat stew in an intense habanero-spiked consommé, or tender and fatty lamb barbacoa tacos. Cold accompanying salsas are so divine one could skip the chips and just eat them-with a spoon."

Kick things off with the feather-light house-made gnocchi, topped with a feisty sausage ragout; or homemade fazzoletti al rosmarino-chewy, rosemary-laced ""kerchiefs"" served with earthy white beans, tomato and crushed pepper.

First get a drink in your hand, then start with fave e cicoria, a straightforward purée of fava beans and garlicky chicory greens. A well-rounded Italian meal must have pasta, so be sure to indulge in the likes of orecchiette with broccoli rabe and garlic, enhanced by anchovies and breadcrumbs.

Leather banquettes line the wall, and pendant bulbs illuminate one of several beautiful oil paintings of a meadow. Inside, the restaurant jumps with Williamsburg’s finest—along with more than a few bridge-hoppers from Manhattan and beyond. And that’s on a slow night. The fuss is quite merited. Despite ample competition in this section of town, Chef/owner Polo Dobkin and wife, Stephanie Lempert, manage to elevate the kitchen’s dishes into next level territory, and they do so in a lovely, urbane setting with loads of charm and friendly service. The inventive American menu gets a lift from Mediterranean accents: a bowl of deliciously chewy squid ink ""fettuccine"" arrives with Spanish octopus, chorizo, hot chili and breadcrumbs.

The cocktail bar is as dedicated as the kitchen, mixing martinis that are almost as destination-worthy as the 32-ounce Porterhouse steaks. Like any self-respecting chophouse, sides like buttery whipped potatoes, nicely balanced wedge salads, and on-point desserts are traditional and delicious. However, those thick cuts of dry-aged, top-tier steaks are a perfectly rare treat. Meats are cooked with tremendous precision and paired with the likes of a glossy sauce Diane, dotted with soft peppercorns."

Everything here carries a certain weight, beginning with the heavy wooden door and carrying through to the bill. The room of course is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you’ll forget it’s on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed and at times it may seem like a bit much, but a reverential spirit is part of your meal here. Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at-the-ready carrying their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and bits of insight. Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef's signature glass coup of minced toro and a very fine-and very generous-pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is downright wondrous, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin, melting sheets of white truffle.

Scrawled on a chalkboard, these may include raw offerings and nostalgic desserts like hot fudge sundaes. Crowds pack into the stainless steel counter and fans spin lazily overhead. The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side.

"MarkJoseph","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.markjosephsteakhouse.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Well positioned on a historic and touristy stretch to attract diners from near and far, MarkJoseph is more approachable than the clubby competition, but rest assured that these steaks are treated with the utmost care. The dining room looks rather masculine, flaunting chairs with plush fabric and dark brown pinstripes. This is the kind of place where the namesake salad does away with lettuce, leaving a refreshing combo of poached shrimp, porky bits of lardons, string beans and beefsteak tomatoes. Meticulously chosen, aged, and cooked steak, often served sizzling on platters for two or more, is what distinguishes this dedicated and skilled kitchen.

"Marcha Cocina","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.marchanyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Colors evoke the Caribbean at Marcha, a narrow restaurant known for authentic Spanish tapas. A long bar dominates the sea-blue and sunny-yellow room filled with high tables and a convivial crowd. The music is a touch loud, but the service is refreshingly down-to-earth, and the food impresses beyond what its neighborhood bar-vibe might suggest. The menu is broad and affordable, which makes a perfect excuse to sample widely. Staples from tender tortilla Española to gambas al ajillo are delicious executions of classic tapas. Ribbons of luscious Spanish ham are on handsome display in the hongos e higos coca, a chewy flatbread also topped with mushrooms, figs, and buttery almonds.

Its urbane clientele ensures the atmosphere remains as sophisticated as ever and the restaurant keeps its side of the deal by providing polished, confident service and a smart, comfortable environment. Fish and shellfish are the stars of the show and Italian the chosen language. At first glance the menu can appear intimidating, as the choice is considerable—but once you’ve decided to have four courses (and it would be churlish to have any fewer) then it all falls into place with the prix-fixe. Nothing starts a meal like crudo and the selection here is impressive, but also consider generously sized antipasti, like creamy white polenta with calamari. Pasta is yet another highlight and leads nicely into the fish course. The quality and condition of the fish are extraordinary, but that would count for little if the kitchen didn't get the cooking process spot on-and it does. Try the wild striped bass and you'll see just how perfect the timings are. Add in an impressive Eurocentric wine list, strong in Italy and Burgundy, and you have all the ingredients for a great meal."

The innovative American food excites with bold flavors, as in barbecued oysters sprinkled with pancetta powder. Montauk fluke en croute, set over roasted cauliflower, hazelnuts, and capers topped with a buttery panel of toast, is dressed with sauce proposal-so named because the rich brown butter and golden raisin emulsion is said to have earned the chef a few romantic offers.

Most of the menu is given over to raw seafood and New England classics; part, to Mediterranean tavern small plates like sweetbreads and steak tartare. Kick things off with the excellent Mar's chowder, bobbing with briny clams, tender potatoes, bacon, and thyme. Then move on to sautéed sweetbreads with buttery fingerlings, pickled onion, and a swirl of balsamic reduction; or the house lobster roll kicked up with salty batons of Granny Smith apple."

The kitchen's talent is equally clear in such preparations as luscious sea urchin served in a chilled shellfish consommé with fragrant lemongrass and thin slices of sweet grapes. Heartier appetites will delight in a thick, juicy pork Porterhouse, glazed with jus, served alongside braised kale, roasted beets, and finished with zippy horseradish cream."
"Maison Harlem","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.maisonharlem.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A steady stream of locals, phone-toting tourists, and City College academics filling these well-worn wooden tables proves that this bistro has little trouble attracting a crowd. Floor-to-ceiling windows, dark red banquettes, and quirky touches like vintage Gallic posters or football jerseys tacked to the walls lend a whiff of whimsy. Maison Harlem's menu plays around with culinary traditions, with results that may include a classic rendition of coq au vin with smoky lardons, browned button mushrooms, and fresh noodles to garnish the wine-braised chicken pieces.

Pizzas showcase quality ingredients, like fior di latte, pecorino, and cherry tomatoes over an impressively thin crust. Also try the finely tuned pastas, like carrot agnolotti ""serpente"" topped with amaretti and mint-hazelnut crumble in brown butter. ""Al forno"" items are an absolute highlight.

Of course, the service is just as polished as the design. Though the kitchen bills itself as a steakhouse, you can't go wrong with the excellent raw bar, creative fish entrées (maybe the ""trout no trout"" composed with potatoes and cabbage?), and unique appetizers.

The term pizzeria just doesn't do this lovely spot justice. And judging by the patient crowds lined up outside, the neighborhood knows a good thing when they see it. Once inside, guests are treated to a charming interior of exposed brick, mismatched chairs, and kitschy knickknacks. Soft Italian music plays beneath the happy hum of friends and family chatting."

The flavors of wood infuse every element of a thick, blistered pizza decked with potatoes, pancetta, sweet onions, and gently poached eggs.

What really sets it apart, however, is the service: the restaurant is run with lots of flair and no little professionalism by a vast army of servers-this is not one of the places where you need to use semaphore to get noticed by your waiter. The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele do not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain.

Our most delightful places","http://www.thenomadhotel.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","The reputation of the seductively louche NoMad hotel, housed within a strikingly bohemian Beaux-Arts building, owes much to the considerable talents of Will Guidara and Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, as they look after all things relating to food and drink. The glass-roofed Atrium is the chief pleasure dome but a meal in NoMad’s land is a moveable feast and some prefer eating in the more languid surroundings of the Parlour, where there’s a little less head swiveling and competitive dressing. Wherever you sit, you’ll find the service confident and engaging and the menu hugely appealing. Don't come expecting the culinary pyrotechnics of Eleven Madison Park: here it's about familiar flavors in more approachable, less intricate dishes, but with the same care and understanding of ingredients. Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two. Bone marrow adds depth to beef, while asparagus with bread sauce shows the kitchen is equally adept when subtlety is required. For dessert, look no further than the aptly named ""Milk & Honey."""
"Nom Wah Tea Parlor","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.nomwah.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","First things first: you don't go to Nom Wah Tea Parlor for the décor or the service. The latter is polite and ultra-speedy, but otherwise forgettable. And the décor offers little more than pleather booths and a diner-style counter. None of this matters, for once the kitchen starts dropping its lip-smacking Chinese-American fare down with aplomb, you'll be in dim sum heaven. Begin with soft and tender shrimp-and-snow pea leaf dumplings, before moving on to unique bean curd skin rolls tucked with savory Chinese pork. Downright terrific pan-fried dumplings are filled with pink shrimp and fragrant chives. Don't leave without sampling the restaurant's ""Original Egg Roll,"" which is basically a massive umami bomb, easily split between four people."
"Nix","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.nixny.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Named for the 19th century Supreme Court case that ultimately decided tomatoes are indeed a vegetable, Nix is a bright young starlet backed by some heavy hitters. Chefs John Fraser and Nicolas Farias are crafting a vegetarian cuisine that makes you wonder if meat might be holding back vegetables—here they shine without it. The service team is as on-point and well-versed as a letter from the editor (Condé Nast’s former Editorial Director is a partner and frequently oversees the dining room). No surprise that it fills with a unique crowd of fashionista foodies that are as visually appealing as those light fixtures sculpted from juniper roots. Green plants and skylights keep everything looking healthy and bright—it’s a welcoming scene. The two à la carte menus offer intriguing vegetarian options or a more concise vegan one, which has many of the same compositions minus the dairy. Playful highlights include crisply charred avocado a la plancha served in a pool of tomato water, salted and spiked with jalapeño, finished with bits of fresh mozzarella. Fuji apple sorbet begins as a fragrant dessert, then pops with the inventive flavors of candied olive and lime."
"No. 7","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.no7restaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","With its worn-in good looks, it's no surprise that No. 7 is this neighborhood's favorite hangout-a place where a cool crowd sip at the lively bar and sink into the dining room's sumptuous, horseshoe-shaped banquette. Add to that a menu so intriguingly original, it started a movement (the brand now includes kiosks serving sandwiches and veggie burgers), and you've got a recipe for success. A delicious alchemy is at work in this open kitchen creating the likes of braised pork shoulder-stuffed cabbage paired with grilled stone fruit panzanella. Starters and dessert here are every bit as fun as the main event. The proof is in the perfectly ripe avocado topped with smoked trout, tobiko, and jalapeño oil, followed by the decadent brandy Alexander tiramisu."
"New Wonjo","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.newwonjo.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","New Wonjo offers a delightful respite in this jam-packed quarter of K-town. The modest space is spread over two floors and is mighty popular for barbecue-seeking groups. The fact that these grills still use charcoal only adds to the overall lure. And no matter the time, one can expect to find hordes of diners huddling around platters of marinated beef short ribs (kalbi) or thinly sliced pork belly (samgyupsal). Non-barbecue delights include mandoo, chap chae and cochu pa jeon. But, keep room to savor soups like ban gye tang-a soothing ginseng-infused broth bobbing with sticky rice- garlic- and jujubes-stuffed chicken. Gobdol bi bim bap with minced beef, a runny egg, and other spicy condiments is wonderfully flavorful but only incendiary upon request."
"New Leaf","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.newleafrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Talk about wowing your dinner date. Located in a 1930's slate and fieldstone cottage tucked away in Upper Manhattan's Fort Tryon Park, New Leaf Café was opened as part of the New York Restoration Project. With its stone walls and arched windows, the interior is just lovely. And lunch out on the flagstone terrace is downright stunning-offering unparalleled views of the dramatic Palisades and (if you squint a bit) the George Washington Bridge. Delicious and modern American food is the name of the game at this kitchen. The menu touches on some usual crowd favorites (think juicy burgers and soft beignets) along with trendy, veggie-based items like avocado smeared on toasted crostini; a bowl of greens and grains; and a falafel burger."
"Nargis Cafe","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.nargiscafe.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This industrial strip is ground zero for Central Asian hot spots, where Nargis Cafe endures as a real treat. Composed of a front bar area and larger, brighter dining room, the entire space is brought together with marvelous Persian rugs and exotic pierced-metal sconces. Nargis hits a strong stride among the locals for its convivial vibe and unique repertoire of dishes that may include a bojon salad of smoky eggplant tossed with garlic, peppers, carrots, and cucumber. Kebabs are taken seriously here, so try the succulent lamb with chopped onion and dill. Uzbek plov studded with chickpeas, lamb, and raisins is simple but imperative. For dessert, the honey-sweet chak-chak is fried but surprisingly light and exquisitely indulgent."
"Mythos","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.mythosnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A gathering place for Greeks and non-Greeks alike, this family-run and friendly restaurant tempts with impeccably fresh fish, cooked over charcoal and basted simply with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs. Beyond the whitewashed exterior and dark blue awning is a large dining room with rows of neat tables for indulging in Hellenic pleasures, from zesty appetizers to boisterous conversations. Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing. Finish with a choice of authentic, nutty, and syrup-soaked pastries."
"Mr. Taka","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.mrtakaramen.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","When the chef of a successful Tokyo ramen-ya opens a spot in NY, success is virtually guaranteed. Mr. Taka may seem small and simple, but the food is fun and distinctive. The cooking here is a delicious break from tradition, thanks to ramen that ranges in toppings from avocado to the richest slice of pork belly on this side of the Pacific. Of course, all of these garnishes depend on the broth-the spicy miso ramen is made with chicken and bonito, wafting with aromas that are at once spicy, savory, and sweet. These thick ribbons of noodles have a springy, bouncy texture that is never lost within the mounds of bean sprouts, scallions, soft-boiled egg, and much more. Other highlights include a crunchy hijiki salad and piping-hot batons of deep purple sweet potato tempura."
"Moti Mahal Delux","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.motimahaldelux.us","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This corner spot marks the first American location of a fine dining chain that began in Delhi and now boasts outposts throughout India. Here in NYC, Moti Mahal Delux offers two distinct seating areas: an earth-toned dining room and windowed sidewalk atrium. Their Northern-leaning cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indian subcontinent. Lunch is limited, while dinner is more rewarding, featuring tandoori preparations like anardana tikka-grilled chicken infused with a pomegranate and black pepper marinade. Delightful flavors abound through the brick-red mutton curry with spiced tomato, onion, and ginger; paratha dusted with dried mint; as well as the mustard seed- and curry leaf-infused lemon rice."
"Momofuku Noodle Bar","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.momofuku.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This elder member of David Chang's culinary empire is hipper and hotter than ever. A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind. Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew's signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame."
"Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.spoonbreadinc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Come to Miss Mamie's and plan to indulge, Southern style. This tiny institution sports a bright, clean dining room, and is furnished with comfortable wicker chairs, roomy tables, and lots of flower arrangements. But despite its somewhat sophisticated appearance, the kitchen still embraces such tried-and-true classics as fried chicken thighs with black-eyed peas and collard greens, Louisiana catfish, and a creamy red velvet cake for dessert. Grab a fresh-squeezed lemonade and dive into the sampler, stocked with deep-fried shrimp, fall-off-the-bone beef short ribs, more fried chicken, and probably too many sides of cornbread stuffing and hoppin' John. And if on offer, devour a wedge of the decadent and classically Southern banana pudding."
"Momofuku Ssäm Bar","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.momofuku.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","You can't go wrong with anything porcine at Founder David Chang's East Village stalwart, so kick off with a steamed pork belly bun or slices of nutty Broadbent ham to get you in the mood for more meat eating. Having something wrapped, in homage to the name, is also a wise choice but consider too the platters, whether that's rotisserie duck or spiced beef brisket-they arrive on metal trays which adds some penitentiary chic to proceedings. The place has a laid-back vibe, although newbies may have to cajole the servers into offering guidance on what-and how much-to order. At least the prices mean you can do so with giddy abandon. Take care if you're on a date as the zeal with which you devour your food may be a little off-putting to potential mates."
"Miss Lily's","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.misslilysnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Authentic Jamaican flavors and thumping reggae go hand-in-hand amid Miss Lily's bright orange booths, retro artifacts, and Formica-topped tables. Wide-open windows overlooking buzzy Houston Street merely add to the allure. A well-stocked bar and bins filled with produce set the mood for enjoyable classics brought to you at the hands of glam servers. Start with jerk chicken that is insanely moist yet nearly black with intense spices, served with a Scotch bonnet sauce that will have your mouth tingling for hours. Then cool down with Melvin's ""body good"" salad tossing kale, radish, celery, and apples in a citrus-ginger vinaigrette. From the Jamaican Sampler-think curry goat, oxtail stew, and callaloo-to a boozy rum cake, this Caribbean queen reigns supreme."
"Molyvos","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.molyvos.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Yes, it's true: the city has upped its Greek game in recent years. But Molyvos has more than earned its OG status-having served fresh, Mediterranean cuisine to a loyal uptown crowd for over twenty years. The secret to its longevity lies in the kitchen's beautifully simple and enjoyable food, smart, polished service, and casually elegant setting (tables covered in white cloth and a spare, rustic aesthetic). Executive Chef Carlos Carreto oversees this terrific menu. Among a host of delicious sounding (and tasting) options is the grilled octopus with marinated chickpeas and artichokes."
"Nyonya","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.ilovenyonya.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Nyonya flaunts a comfy setting composed of brick walls and basic wood tables, but really, everyone's here for their outstanding Malaysian food. Speedy servers steer diners through the varied menu-and perhaps even away from such delicacies as prawn mee, an exceptionally spiced and sour shrimp broth with noodles, pork, vegetables and bean sprouts floating in its goodness. Asians and other locals know to stick to such faithful and deeply satisfying dishes as nasi lemak, which is a delightful combo of coconut rice, pickled veggies, crispy anchovies, curried chicken and hard-boiled egg. Mee siam spotlights noodles stir-fried with tofu and shrimp in a chili sauce that puts all others to shame, while coconut batter-fried jumbo prawns are nothing short of-omg-wow!"
"Miss Korea","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.misskoreabbq.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","24-hour access to delicious Korean food? Yes please, Miss Korea. Located in the heart of K-Town, this popular restaurant is guaranteed to have a line out the door during peak dinner hours, but once inside you'll find a fairly serene décor, with each of its floors dedicated to a unique aspect of Korean culture. The first floor offers the most robust menu; the second floor is more intimate, with Zen-like private dining rooms and a set menu featuring Imperial cuisine. Each floor is packed with blonde wooden tables fixed with grills. However, make sure to go for the outstanding clay pot galbi highlighting tender USDA Prime beef short ribs marinated on the bone for 24 hours, then cut tableside and grilled to heavenly perfection on the spot."
"Miss Ada","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.missadanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Middle Eastern eateries are popping up faster than you can say labne, but Miss Ada stands apart from the pack. This Fort Greene charmer delivers a one-two punch of good looks and great food. Rustic chic meets urban cool in the dining room, but wait, what’s that out back? It’s only the most darling backyard patio and garden beseeching you to plant yourself and stay a while. Chef Tomer Blechman puts his own stamp on the ancient cuisine of the Middle East with hit after delicious hit. Even items that seem basic-creamy, smooth hummus and the fluffy cloud-like pita-are elevated here. Smoky octopus, so tender and fragrant, is ramped up with grassy Castelvetrano olives, while hanger steak is bathed in a charred onion tahini that has you begging for more."
"Lupa","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.luparestaurant.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Is there anything more lovely than a lazy weekend lunch at Batali and Bastianich's Lupa? You'd be hard-pressed to convince the regulars who flock here in droves day and night for the amicable service, interesting wines, and otherworldly pasta. Everything on the menu is so lovingly sourced: witness a warm spinach and pancetta salad tossing a perfect mix of vibrant greens with warm, smoky bacon; or starter of plump, marinated sardines laced with oil and coarse salt and served over a bed of miniscule cubes of cucumber and celery. But the star of the show remains the pasta, which may reveal decadent bavette cacio e pepe, a classic dish from Lazio. It's nothing short of sweet satisfaction, dotted with sharp pecorino and freshly ground black pepper."
"The Odeon","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.theodeonrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's easy to see why The Odeon has been a part of the fabric of TriBeCa life for so long. Like watching a re-run of Seinfeld, it is reassuringly familiar, classically New York and, even when you know what's coming next, still eminently satisfying. The menu is a roll-call of everyone's favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions. The room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passer-by. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself."
"The Musket Room","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.themusketroom.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","New Zealander Matt Lambert appears to be on a mission to debunk some stereotypes and defy a few expectations about his homeland. For a chef raised in a country famous for its wild, rugged terrain and obsession with rugby, his contemporary cuisine is surprisingly subtle, thoughtful and at times even quite delicate—and if you come here expecting to find lamb on the menu, you’ll probably be disappointed. It is obvious that this is a kitchen with a mastery of all the modern culinary techniques. Don’t go thinking this is all about presentation though, because the dishes really do deliver on flavor and are ridiculously easy to eat. Nothing demonstrates the ability here more than the succulent New Zealand venison accompanied by “flavors of gin” which are dots of juniper meringue, fennel, and a licorice-infused sauce. Even that antipodean classic, the pavlova, is given a new lease of life by not so much being deconstructed as being reinvented, as a subtle and delicious delicacy made with passion fruit. The warm and inviting room fits seamlessly into the neighborhood and comes with a 20-foot walnut timbered bar and lime-washed exposed brick walls."
"The Modern","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.themodernnyc.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","It goes without saying that The Modern has one of the city’s most prized locations, designed to capture the iconic feel of the MoMA in which it is seamlessly housed. Art enthusiasts have always appreciated its timeless and glorious surrounds; and thanks to an ambitious nip-tuck, they are sure to notice the improved acoustics, which facilitate quiet conversation and match the calm of the view over the sculpture garden. The state-of-the-art kitchen allows the team to grow into its full creative potential—both in the dining room and at the buzzy bar. But for a truly special experience, book the chef's table (complete with a multi-course tasting menu) inside the kitchen. Chef Abram Bissell and crew are wowing these globe-trotting patrons with excellent food and warm, well-timed service. Appealing dishes showcase clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower with crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée, and crabmeat. Delicate balance and top ingredients are at the height of tender lobster “marinated with truffles” and served in a luscious sauce with radishes and herbs. For dessert, rhubarb bread pudding is crowned with vanilla-mascarpone mousse for a bit of flourish and whole lot of fun."
"The Metrograph Commissary","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.metrograph.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Located on the second floor of The Metrograph theater—a small, independent two-screen movie house in the Lower East Side—The Commisary channels an old Hollywood vibe. Picture retro furniture, potted palms, and plenty of cozy nooks to relax in. The food is simple but sophisticated for the neighborhood, offering a lovely American slant on bistro fare. Even the concessions downstairs are worth perusing for their unusual selection. The menu is brief but tempting, with small plates of steak tartare, fluke crudo and burrata getting play next to classic salads (think Waldorf and kale Caesars), as well as pleasing entrées like roasted chicken, steak frites and brown butter trout. Comforting sides like mac-and-cheese and steamed broccoli make it a truly American affair."
"The Mermaid Inn","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.themermaidnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This laid-back and inviting seafood spot has been a neighborhood favorite for over a decade now, spawning locations in Greenwich Village and the Upper West Side. A steady stream of guests lines the bar early in the week for Monday's five to seven happy hour with freshly shucked oysters, snack-sized fish tacos, and other specially priced bites. For a hearty plate after your nosh, try blackened catfish dotted with crawfish butter alongside hushpuppies, or the lobster roll with Old Bay fries. On Sunday nights, look out for lobsterpalooza-a whole lobster accompanied by grilled corn on the cob and steamed potatoes. At the end of your meal there's no need to deliberate over dessert. A demitasse of perfect chocolate pudding is presented compliments of the house."
"The Little Owl","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.thelittleowlnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Straddling a picturesque corner of the West Village, with a name that could charm the pants off the grizzliest city diner, The Little Owl has a lot going for it up front. Light pours in from the windows as people stand outside, catching up and chatting with friends. Inside, bright flowers dot the quaint room; and a thoughtful service staff ushers you through your meal. And then there's Chef Joey Campanaro, who hits his seasonal menu out of the park, weaving top-notch ingredients into comforting creations that are as rustic as they are disciplined. An Italian wedding soup is sourced from local urban gardens and loaded with tender polpettine; while a beautifully seared halibut arrives with fluffy chive-mashed potatoes and a drizzle of lemon crème fraîche."
"Via Carota","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.viacarota.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Occasionally, predictability can be a beautiful thing, especially when it comes to rave-worthy Italian cooking. Via Carota is not so much robotically perfect as it is pleasing-in fact it's the kind of place where dishes can (and should) be piled on. Italian style and artistry combine in this homey space that features bare wood farm tables, sideboards, and whitewashed brick. A no-reservations policy means long waits that are actually worth it, so join those lines. Diners may start nibbling on deep-fried olives that are plump, piping hot, and stuffed with pork sausage. Then, a luscious (and unmissable) risotto cacio e pepe arrives loaded with pecorino and fresh pepper. For dessert, the simple-sounding flourless chocolate cake is downright excellent."
"Vaucluse","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.vauclusenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","There is no shortage of good looks in this part of town and Michael White's bold restaurant fits in nicely. It's certainly an impressive space, dressed in neutral tones. It's also a big space, with a bar that divides two dining rooms-one on the upper level that is less formal, while the lower level room has a more animated air. The name refers to a department in France's southwest; and while service here may not be as luxe as the setting, this is proud and classical brasserie fare. There is a lot of choice on offer-bouillabaisse, grillades for those who like their food familiar, fruits de mer, and a notable selection of meat and fish. The kitchen reveals its confidence by ensuring that plates are never overcrowded. Desserts, like Paris-Brest or crème brûlée, are a highlight."
"Vesta Trattoria","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.vestavino.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Ever-changing daily specials and a respectable wine list-celebrated with a weekday happy hour-have fostered the favorable reputation of Astoria's favorite trattoria.

To that end, tender meatballs are braised in a serrano chili-sparked tomato sauce; and free-range chicken Milanese is plated with a swipe of roasted lemon purée. For dessert, la torta del piccolo bambino Gesu Cristo reveals a block of excellent sticky toffee pudding cake that arrives warm, caramel-soaked, and capped with a refreshing scoop of crème fraîche sorbet."
"Ushiwakamaru","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.ushiwakamarunewyork.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Now firmly settled into its Chelsea home in a former tavern, Ushiwakamaru may no longer have that underground feel of a sushi-ya that only the most dedicated aficionados know about. However, it remains home to luxe sushi and excellent fish. The brief menu lists wallet-friendly à la carte specials, small plates, and cooked items like sautéed lobster and asparagus, but you may choose to ignore all that. Chef Hideo Kuribara’s true focus is on the very impressive omakase, served as a choice of 14 or 20 superb courses. A bowl of pickled cucumber stimulates the appetite as a series of cold dishes arrive, with highlights like chopped horse mackerel with green onion and shiso leaf. Then move on to sashimi that proves just how incredibly fresh the fish here is. Delve into perfectly cut octopus simply dressed with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon; or needlefish served with a bowl of grated ginger, green onion slivers, and soy for dipping. Each morsel of nigiri is crafted at the dining counter and presented on a ceramic slab, ready to be plucked with your fingers. Expect large, cool mouthfuls of Japanese sea urchin, lightly torched fatty tuna with truffle salt, and rich shad brushed with soy."
"Uva","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.uvanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Perpetually packed and always pleasing, this cousin of elegant Lusardi's is a rocking, rustic good time. Votive-filled nooks and fringed sconces cast a flattering light on the inviting room furnished with straw-seat chairs and wooden tables laden with wine bar-themed small plates. Cheeses, meats, and salads are fine ways to start. The insalata di manzo is a tasty hybrid of all three-shaved lean beef topped with peppery young arugula, nutty parmesan, and pickled mushrooms. Join the crowds at the start of the week for Meatball Mondays offering three courses revolving around...you guessed it. Sample the hearty beef meatball ravioli garnished with sliced artichoke hearts, silky smooth tomato sauce, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

Everything seems to click at Upland-the restaurant's interior design is urbane but cozy, with vintage flooring and glowing jars of preserved lemons and backlit wine bottles lining the walls. Earthy and bountiful, it's the perfect backdrop for Smillie's gorgeous Mediterranean-influenced dishes. A meal in this kitchen's capable hands might reveal a small plate of crispy duck wings, glossy with yuzu sauce; or a plate of estrella, star-shaped tubular pasta with crushed chicken livers, herbs, and pecorino.

Talented Chef Suzanne Cupps oversees the operations here, and the results are anything but ordinary. Witness this vegetable-focused carte reveal the likes of marinated mussels with fava, yellow eye beans and edible flowers; or stradette tossed with broccoli rabe pesto, French beans, and mushrooms. Then throw caution to the wind and close out with a triple-layer peanut butter and blueberry crunch cake."
"Union Square Cafe","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.unionsquarecafe.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Union Square Cafe is to NYC as steel is to skyscrapers, so regulars practically went into mourning when news broke that it was shuttering. But Danny Meyer doesn't disappoint, and when it re-opened nearly a year later in a shiny new locale, everyone breathed a sigh of relief-and promptly made reservations. Nobody does relaxed elegance like the aforementioned restaurateur, and this two-story space is no exception. Service is exemplary whether you're a local or Broadway star, and the menu is filled with upmarket takes on crowd faves-everything from the ever-popular burger to a silky and savory cauliflower sformato. And with an option like triple-layer espresso chocolate cake with locally roasted espresso ganache on the menu, you'd be crazy to skip dessert."
"Tuome","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tuomenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This Asian-leaning contemporary gastropub employs classic technique for sublime results.

This transporting little gem—compliments of talented husband-wife duo Matt Danzer and Ann Redding—brings the Northern Thai experience stateside with creative cuisine and whimsical drinks—Singha beer slushies anyone? Tucked along the eastern edge of Spring Street, the dining room is den-like. A vibrant crowd keeps the place popping through the night, as does the gentle stream of Thai pop music in the background. Though tables are mini, the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision—a window into where the magic happens offers views of a slow-rotating rotisserie and crackling embers. Danzer and Redding's dishes are certainly rooted in this nation's cuisine, but they give each dish a unique spin thereby infusing vibrant flavor into small plates, large plates, ""charcoal-grilled goodies,"" desserts and drinking snacks. Laab neuh gae features delicious ground lamb tossed with pickled onion, lime, and fish sauce, while a banana blossom salad with rotisserie chicken and buttery cashew nuts arrives in an appetizing coconut dressing. For an epic end, go for grilled pork jowl, topped with watermelon radish, salted duck yolk, and a shake of sawtooth herb."

Freshly made trenette pasta is twirled with pesto Trapanese, a divinely rich combination of tomatoes, almonds, garlic, and basil; while the flavors of pizza, topped with red onions, capers, and tuna, call Sicily's sparkling coastline to mind."
"Tribeca Grill","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.myriadrestaurantgroup.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Beckoning business titans day and night, this corner restaurant is a destination for its big, bright dining room with well-spaced tables. Wall-to-wall windows overlook two quintessential TriBeCa streets, while exposed brick, moody artwork, and a spectacular bar smack in the center of the room complete the refined vibe. Gigantone, large tubular pasta loaded with braised short rib Bolognese beneath a dollop of fresh sheep's milk ricotta, makes a rich start to a meal. The decadence continues with seared scallops over creamy carrot risotto, topped with a truffled-Madeira vinaigrette, and brought over the top with a few fragrant shavings of black truffle. Desserts are as classic as the space; try the banana tart with malted chocolate and pecan ice cream."
"Trattoria L'incontro","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.trattorialincontro.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A litany of delights sets the stage for an entertaining evening at this beloved institution of Italian-American pleasure. Frescoes of tranquil Italian scenes adorn coral walls in the unfussy dining room, complete with white-clothed tables spread at an ample distance. Service is relaxed, professional, and even theatrical in their performance of reciting special upon special. Flavors are classic and robust, from eggplant rollatini stuffed with ricotta and herbs to the ravioli golosi, filled with both ground filet and veal, then topped with a sauce of mushrooms and sausage. Tender veal scaloppini is gently dredged and pan-fried, then bathed in a silky sauce of wine, butter, garlic, and lemon. Crunching through crisp cannoli is a divine finale."
"Tra Di Noi","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tradinoi.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Decked out with crimson walls and red checkered tablecloths, this is the kind of place where diners feel like they're in on a delicious secret-and that's no coincidence, as Tra Di Noi is Italian for ""between us."" Responsible for the success behind this tiny spot is Chef/owner Marco Coletta, who directs the front and back of house with the precision of an air traffic controller and the passion of an Italian nonno. This sincerity shines through in the cooking, from the ethereally light gnocchi di patate in a rich lamb ragù to the quickly pan-fried fillet of sole Francese nestled in a creamy lemon sauce with shrimp, parsley, and white wine. Only a few desserts are on offer, and all are made in house. For a classic finale, go with the ricotta cheesecake."
"Tito Rad's Grill","","Under 25 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.titorads.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This eclectic grill seduces with its perfectly encapsulated fusion of the Malay, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese flavors that typify the wholly unique cuisine of the Philippines. Cozy touches accent the décor and a mix of light stone with dark wood strikes just the right balance between contemporary and familiar. Bold and generously portioned, the authentic specialties here have amassed a devout following. Highlights from the extensive pork- and seafood-dominated menu might include binagoongang baboy, tender chunks of pork cooked in a shrimp paste-sparked sauce made rich with melted fat; and adobo fried rice studded with crunchy and delicious bits of pork belly skin. If it's on offer, be sure to opt for the inihaw na panga or grilled tuna jaw."
"Tori Shin","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.torishinny.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Chefs Shu Ikeda and Atsushi Kono continue to honor the art of grilling at this popular and much loved destination. A small bar pouring sake, shochu, and Japanese whiskey welcomes patrons into the multi-level dining room, featuring myriad table seating options that include a mezzanine with gold leaf walls. However, nothing compares to the entertainment of sitting at the counter, in front of the chefs fanning charcoal. This may be a serious and sophisticated restaurant, but the warm service as well as the upbeat atmosphere keep it approachable. The focus is on organically raised chicken parts sizzling over the binchotan-fired grill, where embers are coaxed or cooled with extreme care. A varied selection of skewers is the high point of dining here, so be sure to try crisped wing, seared heart, and creamy liver—all of which need nothing more than a few grains of salt to impart true flavor. The omakase is a worthy progression that might include kara-age, chicken and duck tsukune, blistered shishito peppers, and bowls of springy ramen. If you're here with friends, go à la carte as it's an ideal way to sample a host of options, which may also unveil favorites like chicken cha-shu."
"Tiny's","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.tinysnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The name says it all-Tiny's is indeed tiny, but in that old New York, wood-burning fire, and pressed-tin ceiling kind of way. Enter this narrow Federal-style home (c. 1810) and sidle up to the beautiful people along the pew seats that overlook a poster of the Marlboro Man. Alternatively, head on up to the suitably named Bar Upstairs. The setting is so rich with character that one could simply be satisfied by Tiny's fine burger, featuring dry-aged rib-eye and a side of cheddar tater tots. However, this is a surprisingly ambitious kitchen turning out some very clever dishes. The wild Coho salmon for example, is grilled to specification and plated with vadouvan-spiced beurre blanc; while the vanilla flan slicked with cold caramel syrup makes a wonderful finale."
"Timna","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.timna.nyc","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Diners may end up arguing about which of Timna's appetizing and complex Middle Eastern dishes is the most memorable, but almost everything whipped up by Chef Nir Mesika will have you buzzing. Tucked below street level, this deep and narrow space features plenty of exposed brick, as well as a welcoming bar located up front. Start with the addictive kubaneh, a Yemenite brioche-and-challah hybrid served with crushed tomato sauce, butter-thick yogurt, and jalapeño salsa. For a refreshing treat, dive in to the Chinatown salad-glass noodles tossed with a pesto of fragrant herbs, palm sugar, and fish sauce, then topped with crispy tempura green beans. Finish the evening with a yuzu tart featuring piña colada-panna cotta and sweet strawberry coulis."
"Tía Pol","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tiapol.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","You'll think you've died and gone to Barcelona. This cozy little tapas den kicks up to boisterous levels in its bustling and festive front area, where servers uncork bottles and the wine flows as guests cue up for tables in the front or back dining room. The wait is all part of the fun, of course, and service is as cheery, efficient and casual as you'd hope it to be. Originally opened in 2004, owners Heather Belz & Mani Dawes offer a scrumptious array of small plates like creamy black rice plated with shaved cuttlefish and pale green parsley purée; or a thick wedge of potato-studded tortilla Española, laced with delicious garlicky aïoli. Don't miss the skirt steak, a must-try when it hits the specials menu."
"The Stanton Social","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thestantonsocial.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This stylish downtown looker has been going strong for over a decade now. Unlike the hip spots that burn brightly then fade, The Stanton Social still has the stuff-best evidenced, perhaps, by the throngs of beautiful young things that fill its seats every weekend. That said, it's not so cool that you won't find a family with kids squeaking through the door for an early dinner. Inside the generous space, you'll find sultry purple velvet booths and dark wooden tables. The thumping music and dim lights give it a clubby vibe, as does the bar and lounge upstairs. The food is equally eclectic and playful, with a delicious shareable menu that includes the popular French onion soup dumplings, a ""Big Sexy Burger,"" and Mexican street corn ravioli."
"The Simone","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thesimonerestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Chef Chip Smith and wife Tina Vaughn prove hospitality isn't dead at their posh dining room, where genuine service and excellent cuisine have Upper East Siders giddy. Menus ask diners to refrain from cellphone usage, proving that this is an endearingly old-school spot despite its young age. And the bonhomie present sets the perfect tone for astute cooking. Agnolotti filled with parsnip purée and garnished by crunchy hazelnuts boasts an impeccable start. Then savor a cylinder of flounder, luxuriously scented with Perigord black truffle and served alongside shaved carrots formed into a gratin-like cake and frilled with breadcrumbs. For a true-blue finish, try the Alsatian apple tart topped with torched custard and a single scoop of prune-Armagnac ice cream."
"The Waverly Inn","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.waverlynyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Even a good chunk of years into its charmed existence, it's still the case that one feels very lucky to score a table at Graydon Carter's Waverly Inn-though it's not for the privilege of mixing with the A-List crowd so much as the absolutely outstanding food. Of course, the beautifully renovated 1844 townhouse plays a part too. It spent many of its interim years as a tavern, and its red leather booths, ornate fireplaces and lovely, ivy-covered atrium retain a certain sexy, speakeasy appeal. Everything on the menu is truly sublime: a silky foie gras torchon arrives with bright, juicy melon and pine nut brittle; while creamy Dover sole is delicately browned in butter, then coated in a decadent Hollandaise and served with bright green haricots verts."
"The Sea Grill","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.patinagroup.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This seafood-centric grill looks onto the iconic Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink and is framed by a wall of windows. Inside, find a cool aqua-accented space that inspires dressing up. Yes, tourists flock here after a spin on the ice, but it is also popular among business crowds-especially at lunch when the bar is bustling with sharp suits munching on lobster tail with a martini on the side. The food itself is light and fresh. In-season you may find soft-shelled crab, served alongside a seaweed salad with citrus-marinated hearts of palm. The Northeast supplies many local seafood choices, such as the Block Island golden snapper a la plancha, with tangy cherry-tomato vinaigrette. Dependable and familiar classics like jumbo lump crab cakes are also on offer."
"The Little Beet Table","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thelittlebeettable.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A healthy, wholesome, gluten-free, ""vegetable forward"" menu may sound as appealing as dining with that overly earnest, mildly pious relative you know you should see more often, but in truth there is something irredeemably cute about this more formal offshoot of fast-casual Little Beet. The menu is divided into four sections-small plates, salads, vegetables and mains-but the sizes of dishes vary considerably so it's best to use price as a guide and assemble your own feast. Highlights include crispy pearl rice with shishito peppers and, of course, anything with beets-especially good here when partnered with caramelized fennel. There is actually more meat on the menu that you might expect-the organic herb-roasted chicken is well worth ordering."
"The Farm on Adderley","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thefarmonadderley.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","It's easy to fall in love with The Farm on Adderley with its cozy bar, enclosed back garden, and softly lit dining room, which oozes bonhomie. And then of course, there's the farm-to-table food: neighborhood regulars and borough-hopping gastronomes pack this charmer night and day for irresistible dishes that may include fluffy cheddar omelets. Brunch is a standout as well, but really, any meal here is bound to sate. Kick things off with a bright green salad, dotted with pickled red onion, thick slices of heirloom tomato and plump red raspberries. Then, try a tender nest of spaghettini laced with fresh tomato, briny capers, anchovies, and breadcrumbs; or opt for sizzling pork paired with sunchoke confit and crunchy pistachios."
"The River Café","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.therivercafe.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Thanks to its enviable location and stunning skyline vistas, this waterside favorite more than lives up to its reputation as one of the dreamiest escapes in town. Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs—and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman’s solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with decadent uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen’s focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb—charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior—exemplifies its artistry. Enjoy dessert, as the mouthwatering offerings (think milk chocolate soufflé with melted marshmallow, or dark chocolate marquise topped with a replica of the nearby Brooklyn Bridge) are a veritable education in soigné presentations and sumptuous flavors."
"The Good Fork","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.goodfork.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The Good Fork is a perfect neighborhood restaurant with a serious local following. Located on the food-centric Van Brunt Street near the Red Hook Waterfront, this inviting spot swaps New York pretense for pure passion-it's the dream of a married couple who built the restaurant from scratch, literally. Co-owner Ben Schneider crafted the space, while his classically trained wife, Chef Sohui Kim, helms the kitchen. Her cuisine emphasizes Korean and other global flavors, as well as a commitment to locality. Homemade dumplings are filled with nicely seasoned pork, crisped, and served with black vinegar dipping sauce. Market-fresh bluefish is not only superbly cooked but creatively served with buttery taro root mash, citrus sauce, and pickled radish."
"The Finch","One  Star","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thefinchnyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","If you’ve ever had Brooklyn envy, buckle your seatbelt. Tucked among rows of brownstones straight off the set of a movie, The Finch’s charming location pulls at your heart strings long before Chef Gabe McMackin’s outrageously good food warms your soul. Duck behind the bright blue façade, and things get even better: a warm staff welcomes you to a charming, rustic décor, replete with wood beam ceilings and farmhouse chairs. At the heart of this expansive space, which sprawls out into a series of cozy nooks, is an open kitchen where the chef extraordinaire guides his team to excellence before an audience of diners seated at a Carrara marble counter. Modern yet comforting, McMackin's dishes mix skill and personality. The food is well-executed, satisfying and carefully sourced-from tender shishito peppers, blistered to perfection, with a squirt of lemon and crunchy sea salt, to shaved lamb tongue with fennel, green olives, orange and chili. Chewy cavatelli with yellow foot chanterelles, broccoli rabe, nettles and smoked yolk is yet another highlight, while slices of spot-on Berkshire pork fanned over Calypso beans, littleneck clams, chicory and a sumptuously spicy broth is a fine way to end the affair."
"The Dutch","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.thedutchnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Buzzy and beloved since day one, Chef Andrew Carmellini's The Dutch quickly became a major hit and SoHo institution. Its primo corner windows open on to the sidewalk, tempting guests inside with a stocked oyster bar, cozy banquettes, and sharply dressed service staff. The menu is just as seductive as the space, familiar but with fresh updates. Highlights include a roundabout take on the plump fried oyster po' boy, made here with mustard-pickled okra remoulade. Tasty pastas refresh the menu consistently; you might find black rigatini tossed with tender squid and spicy pork sausage, finished with fiery breadcrumbs. Desserts are divine, with fresh pies made daily, such as salted lime with passion fruit, nata de coco, and coconut sorbet."
"The Clam","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.theclamnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Hugging a corner of the West Village, this shellfish charmer is courtesy of Mike Price and Joey Campanaro. The restaurant's huge windows flood the space with daylight, showing off exposed white brick walls and dark wood accents; by night, pretty sconces cast a soft cozy glow. You should be prepared to wait (and yes, it's worth it), but the bustling bar is a fun spot to gather with friends. The focus at The Clam is, of course, its namesake ingredient, but the menu also features seafood, meat and vegetarian options. Try a delicious tangle of spaghetti and clams in a bright red sauce with glistening greens, chili pepper and scallions; or crispy sweet pea risotto balls served over charred onion-chili crema. The gingerbread ice cream sandwich is unbeatable."
"The Clocktower","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.theclocktowernyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Nothing shouts “Brit” like a billiards room and there’s one to be enjoyed at this swanky dining den of the Edition hotel—a collaboration between restaurateur Stephen Starr and British chef Jason Atherton. The space shares the same decorative style as sibling Berners Tavern, which is housed inside the London Edition, with high ceilings, handsome wood-paneling, and every inch of wall space covered with framed pictures of the good and great. But whereas the London elder is one huge room, this handsome retreat comes divided into three manageable sections, all attended to by a cadre of affable and attentive service staff. There's a subtle and contemporary British accent to the menu too. Their version of fish and chips takes the national dish to a whole new level, with sweet English peas and triple-cooked chips, while a chutney made from plum and shallots is served with tender roasted Long Island duck and woodsy chanterelles. However, there are other European influences at play, so you may start with a decadent crab and uni risotto, or perfectly done quail and pigeon pie. Make sure to end this feast by sharing a plump, bronzed apple tarte Tatin for two coupled with vanilla ice cream."
"The Black Ant","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.blackantnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Bringing a dose of Mexico City chic to the area, this restaurant takes its name from the ancient Mesoamerican fable of an ant and incorporates that imagery throughout the setting. Black-and-white checkerboard flooring, wall tiles bearing the insect's motif, and a very cool giant ant mural reinforce the theme. The menu is an unrestricted look at this nation's cuisine. It is only fitting that specialties here include the Climbing Ant cocktail with tequila, Aperol, and mole bitters; guacamole seasoned with crushed ant salt; and grasshopper-crusted shrimp tacos. Bug-free creations are just as appealing, as in tacos with battered and fried cod cheek, aïoli, and cabbage-mango slaw. For a more traditional but moodier experience, stop by Ofrenda in the West Village."
"The Breslin","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.thebreslin.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Many a culinary crime has been committed in the name of the Scotch egg. However, if you order one here at April Bloomfield’s famed gastropub to enjoy while you scan the menu, you’ll be presented with one that is a thing of such beauty it’ll induce a tear of national pride in every passing Brit. The decorative style in this dining room is that of an English pub designed by an amnesiac émigré. It certainly captures the essence of your typical taproom and has touches of whimsy that every good “local” boasts. However, it also has pure New York City DNA running through it and is an integral part of the Ace Hotel to which it is attached. Come during lunchtime and there's a decently priced set menu, which may include, perhaps with a hint of irony, chicken tikka masala. It's really best to visit for dinner though, when the vibe and the low-level lighting make more sense and the menu is more extensive. Pub food is about bold flavors and familiar combinations, so the lamb burger is a perennial favorite here. But look out for other delights like curried lamb shank or pork shoulder with pancetta, both of which go very well with a pint of Spotted Pig bitter-as indeed does a Scotch egg."
"The Beatrice Inn","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.thebeatriceinn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Its glitzy and glamorous history makes this one of those restaurants about which everyone has an opinion-regardless of whether they've been here or not. The celebrity cavalcade may have now moved on, but that appealing sense of speakeasy secrecy remains, with its low ceiling and even lower lighting adding to the sense of intimacy and intrigue. Chef/co-owner Angie Mar has produced a classic chophouse menu, where meat is king. There are plenty of dishes for sharing, whether that's the dry-aged rack of lamb or the applewood-smoked rabbit, but even standard dishes designed for one are on the hefty size. Flavors are big and bold but the richness of the meat is balanced by a judicious use of herbs and fruits. That said, make sure you come hungry."
"Thai Rock","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.thairock.us","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The ""rock"" in Thai Rock is not just a reference to the restaurant's location in the beachside Rockaways, but a nod to the live music that takes over after the sun dips down. Inside, you'll find tightly packed wooden tables and comfortable high-backed chairs, but the large uncovered patio overlooking the bay is certainly the place to be come summer. The menu covers the usual Thai standards-think pad Thai, curries, and various stir fries-as well as a few Northern Thai specialties, with aplomb. Don't miss the plump and tender dumplings stuffed with crunchy turnips, peanuts, and fragrant garlic; refreshing chicken larb gai, laced with a bright and zesty lime sauce featuring mint and scallion; or the delicious and very savory Issan sausage."
"Tempura Matsui","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.tempuramatsui.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Tempura may be considered a more common pleasure in Japan, but it has been refined to an art form at this home to succulent morsels of fish and vegetables. There is no equal in the city and the kitchen’s delicate hand and authenticity is particularly clear in the lightly seasoned batter that sparingly coats each bit of food before it is quickly fried and rendered crisp. The skill here is so great that they could probably get away with serving lesser quality fish, but still, these are often imported from Tsukiji market in Tokyo at their peak of freshness. Don’t miss the sweet shrimp wrapped in shiso leaf and butterflied Japanese whiting served with purple sweet potato. Meals are bookended with premium sashimi and cooked dishes that are just as enticing, like seared butterfish with a tiny radish, spring pea, and onion. Tilefish is prepared with flavors that seem to conjure spring thanks to cherry leaves, uni, and braised broccoli over sticky rice with sesame and goji berries. The best place to appreciate the kitchen's artistry is from the counter where chefs can be found carefully dipping each little golden nugget of food in and out of boiling oil, then promptly placing it before you."
"Temple Court","","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.templecourtnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Tucked inside the Financial District's Beekman Hotel, which marries old-school glamour with modern indulgences, Temple Court is a stunning addition to the neighborhood. This culinary and architectural feat hails from the Colicchio restaurant family, and Chef Bryan Hunt composes dishes that live up to the hype. Think silky foie gras with bright persimmon; diver scallops with leeks and black truffles; rabbit schnitzel with pistachio; or tender lamb with Niçoise olives, Swiss chard and lemon confit. The lush dining room finds its match in stunning, ceiling-high stained glass windows. But don't leave until you've taken a spin through the adjacent Bar Room, which offers a bevy of serious cocktails and the chance to ogle the impressive nine-level atrium."
"Taverna Kyclades","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tavernakyclades.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Forget the no-frills surroundings and focus instead on the fantastically fresh fish. This beloved Greek spot (with a second location in the East Village) has folks happily dining elbow to elbow in a tiny yet lively space where the bustling kitchen is in view and seafaring scenes paint the walls. Quick, straightforward servers may address you in Greek if you look the part-that's just how local it gets here. Grab a seat on the enclosed patio for some serenity and get things going with garlicky and bubbling hot crab-stuffed clams; or the cold, classic trio of powerful skordalia, cooling tzatziki, and briny taramosalata served with toasted pita triangles. Order a side of horta (steamed escarole and dandelion) to accompany a plate of sweet and delicate mullets, served with a side of lemon potatoes."
"Tastings Social Presents Mountain Bird","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.tastingsnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","The inspiration for Chef Kenichi Tajima and wife Keiko's popular venture no doubt sprung from the popularity of their initial and well-loved incarnation of Mountain Bird. It's clear they were missed, as this hot spot in collaboration with the events organization Tastings Social, stays hopping most nights. This area has wanted for serious food for a while, and Mountain Bird brings it with style-the dining space, tucked into the ground floor of a red rowhouse, is intimate with a small bar and a smattering of wood tables. As the name implies, the menu bears a whimsical devotion to poultry, featuring dishes like hand-cut ostrich tartare; black truffle chicken wings and duck leg-and-turkey sausage cassoulet; along with a nightly seafood and vegetarian option."
"Tanoreen","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.tanoreen.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","One of the city's finest Middle Eastern experiences is tucked into an unassuming Bay Ridge corner and run by Chef/owner Rawia Bishara and her daughter. Meals graciously commence with pickled vegetables and za'atar-dusted flatbread and are followed by a tableful of unique plates brimming with flavors and colors. Turkish salad is actually a bright red tomato spread, shot with harissa and dressed with bits of diced cucumber and a drizzle of excellent olive oil. Appetizers are numerous, but try to fit in the chicken fetti: an entrée of basmati rice pilaf studded with toasted, broken vermicelli and topped with spicy bits of chicken, slivered toasted almonds, a generous drizzle of yogurt-tahini sauce, and chopped parsley for a fresh, final note."
"Tanoshi","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tanoshisushinyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Tanoshi isn't exactly the ""sushi and sake bar"" that the awning lists. It is BYO, so no sake, and a clipboard posted outside the door lists reservations for their two distinct dining rooms. (The right side is nicer.) Settle into Chef Toshio Oguma's true expression of Edomae sushi, as you forgive the lacking service and ambience. Lunch is a limited affair, so come for dinner when it is omakase-only, with the exception of a few handwritten specials. But all that is second to the sushi, which is crafted from loosely formed mounds of warm, akazu-seasoned rice and topped with perfect fish. Highlights include New Zealand king salmon that melts in the mouth, tender amberjack with marinated cherry leaf, as well as bigeye tuna crowned with wisps of kelp."
"Tamarind","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.tamarindrestaurantsnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Building Tamarind cost a cool five million, and it shows-every inch of this soaring space oozes with grandeur. With its classic TriBeCa edifice and gorgeous marble bar (an ideal perch for post-work indulgence), the glass-fronted behemoth draws a posh crowd of Wall Streeters and well-heeled locals. Most impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like nawab shami kabab (lamb patties seasoned with ginger) and hara bhara kabab (pearl-white paneer mingled with bright emerald-green spinach). While service is mediocre at best and the kitchen may fall behind at peak times, mains like kolambi pola (prawns in a coconut-and-chili curry) make up for any gaffes and guarantee a return visit."
"Taboon","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.taboononline.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Taboon's namesake brick-walled, wood-fired oven is burning a bit brighter these days since Chef Efi Nahon has returned to Hell's Kitchen's finest Middle Eastern dining room. That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking an incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here. Bring friends because this midtown marvel's menu is best enjoyed by grazing the list of zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshooka with poached quail egg, or a wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy taleggio and romesco. Vegetables aren't spared the flames either, as evident in a luscious and healthy pile of roasted broccolini splashed with orange oil."
"Yopparai","","50 - 75 USD","Comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.yopparainyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Guests ring a buzzer to gain access to this clandestine izakaya. Inside, you'll find a stylish, serene cubby hole-reservations are a must on popular nights-where every point of your experience has been thoughtfully considered, from the two-person bar stools to the kimono-clad servers with answers at the ready. Two chefs perform their magic in view: one works the grill station while the other tackles sashimi and steamed dishes. A small kitchen in the back pushes out occasional items as well. The menu offers barbecue dishes, robata specials, as well as other seasonal delights. But you'll have the most fun ordering a little of everything-each new presentation is truly an artful revelation. Housed just down the block, Azasu is the modern and much loved sibling."
"Xixa","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.xixany.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Thanks to the trademark style of Chef Jason Marcus, this lovely Mexican favorite draws those chill, relaxed Williamsburg crowds into its slender space. Everything seems to glow beneath etched brass ceiling pendants, as servers carefully place course after well-paced course on those tiny tables. A delicious alchemy is at work here, as evidenced in the remarkably delicate corn flan tamal, topped with buttery roasted corn, set over garlic-poblano cream, and tucked with pickled trumpet mushrooms. Tacos are also absolute standouts, thanks to soft, warm tortillas folded with roasted bone marrow, chorizo marmalade, and charred lime. Like the menu, the beverage listing is loads of fun, with wines whimsically arranged under headings of iconic women."
"X Bar Bistro","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.xbarnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Flaunting an intimate bar and a clutch of small tables nestled into a narrow space lined with pale walls and exposed brick, X Bar Bistro is your perfect little neighborhood date spot-elevated to Chef Danny Brown's expectations, that is. Speaking of, you're likely to see the talented master himself toiling away in the rear kitchen. Inspired by a shuttered Parisian spot favored by the chef, which offered only two well-executed entrées, Chef Brown offers a concise but teasingly good menu here (alongside some delicious libations). Succulent, perfectly cooked duck breast is plated with roasted apricot, celery root purée, wilted mustard greens, and savory jus; while citrus-marinated seafood salad is enriched with asparagus and crushed, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes."
"Yakitori Totto","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.tottonyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","To say that this yakitori-ya nails authenticity is an epic understatement. Its discreet signage and second-floor location feels more Tokyo than Manhattan; J-pop dominates the playlist and the crowd is a reassuring mix of native-speakers and in-the-know foodies. Best of all is the aroma from sizzling skewers, deftly prepared over a charcoal fire. Kitchen classics are also popular, but the house specializes in grilled chicken parts like soriresu (chicken oyster) highlighting a layer of succulent skin. Equally tasty are charred shiitakes and niku yaki, dense rice wrapped in a thin shaving of pork belly and grilled until golden. For dessert, annin tofu showcases silky apricot kernel ""tofu"" appealingly garnished with frozen raspberry and mint."
"Wallsé","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.kurtgutenbrunner.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don’t have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cooking because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there’s a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth—and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Whether you’ve chosen the gamey and fork-tender venison cheek goulash or have gone for the tafelspitz, you’ll find that the dishes here are harmonious, nicely balanced, easy to eat, and even easier to return to enjoy again and again. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings that may even portray the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere. The wine list also merits examination, if only to discover there's more to Austrian wine than Grüner Veltliner."
"Wolfgang's","","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.wolfgangssteakhouse.net","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Wolfgang's is no stranger to the bustling New York steakhouse scene. From the lunch hour business crowd to the lively, post-work bar scene, Wolfgang's jams in locals and tourists alike-each coming for the classic fare and precise Manhattans. The service can be gruff at times, but they have a good track record of squeezing you into a table or perch at the bar without a reservation. Once seated, the bone-in Porterhouse, cooked rare, is the only way to go. It arrives sizzling in its own fat, perfectly seasoned. Save space for a slice of bacon-a must-order appetizer-creamed spinach, and crispy German potatoes with yet more salt and fat (at this point, why not?). Just beware: while dishes are sized to share, they're priced like Maseratis."
"Wallflower","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.wallflowernyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","When a Daniel restaurant veteran opens a casual little cocktail lounge and dining room, the locals will come and never leave. Xavier Herit spent seven years as head bartender at the renowned spot, and his expertise clearly shows in the impressive wine list and complex cocktails-he even crafts a house-made pinot noir syrup for the Scotch-based Père Pinard. The menu is a true deal in this neighborhood, especially with choices from the raw bar and charcuterie. For heartier fare, try the country pâté or rabbit terrine, both classically prepared and perfectly seasoned. Silky beef short ribs are deeply comforting, garnished with bacon, mushroom, cipollini, and just the right amount of brawny sauce. The coffee-chocolate pot de crème is deliciously intense."
"Wa Jeal","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.wajealrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This Sichuan chili house is not merely weathering the local torrent of Second Avenue subway construction; their spotless room and tasty food will make you forget that the outside world exists. The ambience is upscale and appealing, combining pale walls, prescient images of wicked-red chilies, an engaging staff, and a substantial wine list. The chef's specialties reveal the most noteworthy cooking, as in diced fish and crispy tofu stir-fried in a reddish-brown chili sauce speckled with chili seeds and sliced green onions. Sautéed chicken with spiced miso is another pleasure, mixing crisped, boneless pieces, wok-fried with roasted red chilies and charred jalapeños. Tender baby bok choy with garlic is a refreshing contrast to such potent flavors."
"Virginia's","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.virginiasnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Perfectly East Village in scale, this intimate and ambitious bistro named after Owner Reed Adelson's mother is composed of two slender rooms. These are unified by butterscotch-colored banquettes and whitewashed brick walls hung with vintage menus. Fine stemware and items presented on wooden boards lend an upscale manner to the experience. The kitchen takes risks while building upon a steady foundation of timeless classics. A crostino of fava bean tapenade and shredded squash is a wonderful seasonal treat-best paired with an icy glass of rosé. Dry-aged and perfectly seasoned duck with maitake mushrooms and cherries is sauced with a vibrant pea pureé, while baby carrots arranged with a taste of sumac and feta offer a light but bright finish."
"Vida","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.vidany.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","All the locals love Vida, where popular Chef/owner Silva Popaz has created a cozy little restaurant with a firm commitment to simple, but well-executed, dishes. Inside the café-like atmosphere, you'll find unique artwork lining brightly painted walls, and a smattering of tables surrounding a long communal wood table in the center. The charming Popaz travels quite often, and the flavors she picks up along her journeys tend to make their way back into her menu at Vida. The ""Mexican Duo""-her most popular dish-features pulled pork- and chicken-stuffed tortillas, topped with a vibrant Chimayo chile and tangy cheese sauce, and paired with tender stewed beans sporting bright green onion; while a delicate bread pudding arrives puddled in creamy vanilla ice cream."
"Vinatería","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.vinaterianyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Adding to Harlem and its hidden charms is Vinatería, an Italian darling brimming with wines to accompany each sublime bite. Not only is it cozy, but the attractive slate-toned room etched in chalk with scenes of decanters and menu specials will augment your appetite. The semi-open kitchen in the back unveils such treasures as house-cured sardines with fiery piquillo peppers and crunchy croutons; or a salad of earthy golden and red beets mingled with yogurt, oranges, arugula, crunchy pistachios, and tossed with a lemon vinaigrette. Herbs plucked from their copper planters may be featured in an impeccably grilled rosemary-marinated pork blade served with rich mashed potatoes; or desserts like citrus-glazed rosemary panna cotta bathed in chamomile grappa."
"Vinegar Hill House","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.vinegarhillhouse.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","This local standout is situated in a waterfront neighborhood that feels not only charming but utterly untouched by time. The original carriage house was a butcher shop before becoming Vinegar Hill House-a lineage that seems apropos of such steady and perfectly delicious cooking. From the kitchen, diners may expect such rustic and enchanting wood-fired fare as a wintry fennel salad dressed in lemony olive oil and arranged with fronds over a swipe of burnt onion crème (think of the best onion dip you've ever had). Then, dig into a roasted half chicken with copious jus and a splash of snappy sherry vinegar served in a cast-iron skillet. Dark and impossibly moist chocolate Guinness cake is outrageously good, beneath a thick layer of cream cheese frosting."
"Turkish Kitchen","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.turkishkitchen.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Turkish Kitchen showcases all the classics but excels in the preparation of grilled meats. Indulge in yogurtlu karisik, a dish of moist and smoky char-grilled lamb, chicken, and spicy kebabs on a cooling bed of garlic-scented yogurt and pita bread. Pillowy beef dumplings also wade in a pool of that signature sauce topped with paprika-infused oil as well as a dusting of sumac, oregano, and mint. A wide selection of Turkish wines makes a fine accompaniment to a hearty meal. Dangling globe light fixtures give the entrance to this cavernous, multi-level restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows a modern glow. Tables are topped with pristine white cloths and set between black and white striped chairs; cherry-red walls lend a pop of color."
"Sen Sakana","","50 - 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.sensakana.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Understanding this distinctive cuisine requires a bit of history: the 19th century brought large-scale immigration from Japan to Peru, and Nikkei cuisine is its glorious outcome. New York's best place to better understand this style of cooking is this highly anticipated multi-million dollar spot, comprised of a lounge, dining room, and sushi counter. The name meaning ""one-thousand fish"" in Japanese is inspired by the seafood-abundant Peruvian coast; and the menu unveils dishes that seamlessly glide between both cultures' ingredients. The result? Delicious openers like cucumber batons with soy sauce and crispy quinoa, or a lovely ceviche of corvina in lime-y leche de tigre. A selection of skewers from the robata include succulent tsukune and much more."
"00 + Co","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.matthewkenneycuisine.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","There are wine bars and then there is this amazing concept from plant-based food guru, Matthew Kenney. But lets just dwell on this space for a moment. Outfitted with tall, communal tables, backlit wine shelves, and beautiful artwork, the scene inside is both sexy and urbane. With his unique vision behind 00 + Co, the chef contends he is ""crafting the future of food."" There is no dairy or meat here; and by the taste of things, no one's missing it either. A long, tantalizing lineup of low-gluten pizza and ""not pizza"" dominate the menu, along with occasional specials like a wickedly good sweet potato cavatelli. A vegan cheese plate might feature creamy truffled cashew or almond ricotta. All washed down with exquisite organic wine? Food nirvana, indeed."
"Park Avenue","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.parkavenyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","For some, walking into a restaurant one knows well is as comforting as a warm embrace; others may feel there's a thin line between familiarity and monotony. The USP of Michael Stillman's Flatiron establishment is that the decorators and designers change the look of the place four times a year to match the seasons, which is no mean feat considering the vastness of this restaurant. The kitchen sticks to its part of the bargain by also adhering closely to the seasons. Dishes are generally light and easy to eat and the cooks know not to crowd a plate. There are salads aplenty but the best options are those, like the fish dishes, which come with a little dash of Mediterranean color- whatever the weather outside."
"Atoboy","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.atoboynyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Together with his wife, Ellia, Chef Junghyun Park wows diners from start to finish at this Gramercy hot spot with their unapologetic love for Korean food. The fact that they eschew any kind of city pretense in favor of a deeply welcoming atmosphere simply adds to the allure. With its polished cement floors, posters designed by the owners, and row of communal tables, the interior is clean and industrial, and the enticing menu woos diners with its adventurous-yet approachable-take on Korean food. Here you may find creamy braised eggplant with sweet snow crab, tomato, and lemon; or tender squid stuffed with minced pork, shrimp, and paired with a Korean-leaning chimichurri. Close out with firm, oily mackerel swimming in a flavorful soy-green chili bath and set atop cubes of braised daikon."
"Aska","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.askanyc.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","A dramatic space in a former warehouse is made even more theatrical by clever lighting: the darkness of the dining room is juxtaposed with the brightness of the open kitchen, which sits on one side of the room like a stage. Tablecloths are black; the uniforms of the waitstaff are black but your eyes are drawn inexorably towards the white-jacketed chefs as they go about their work with quiet efficiency. Eating here may be a serious business, but happily the place isn’t blighted by a monastic atmosphere—a contented buzz fills the room, helped along by the chefs who deliver the dishes themselves and describe them with contagious enthusiasm. Expect around 19 courses-that may seem daunting but each one, whether a squid tart or meltingly soft dry-aged ribeye, is small and exquisitely formed. Swedish chef Fredrik Berselius and his team use a myriad of techniques from fermenting and pickling to curing, smoking and preserving. This is new Nordic cuisine that celebrates man's relationship with nature and the changing seasons. It's clever without being self-congratulatory, original without being gimmicky, and complex without being complicated-a kitchen shimmering with intelligence."
"Atera","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.ateranyc.com","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","Counter dining can sometimes mean lots of elbows and competitive eaters who enjoy flaunting their food knowledge in front of others. Fortunately, the three-sided counter here at Atera is large enough to ensure you’re sufficiently far from your fellow diners as well as a certain level of privacy while still letting you enjoy the communal, immersive experience. Things are certainly more grown-up and a little less rock-n-roll here than in similarly styled places: there’s barely a tattoo in sight and the soundtrack appears to have been chosen by someone who doesn’t care that much for music. But, it is needed because there can be pauses in conversation when everyone is facing forward. Danish chef Ronny Emborg and his multi-national team serve up a nightly menu of around 20 courses, progressing from the light and subtle to the rich and robust. There may be plenty of tweezer action from the chefs as they plate up their beguiling creations, but they know that there's nowhere to hide when food is this precise and delicate. Dishes also deliver on the promise that their beauty suggests, whether that's the creamy scallop with crisp celery or the succulent loin of lamb with snap peas."
"Atla","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.atlanyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Flatiron favorite Cosme may be doted on by diners and critics alike, but nobody puts Atla in a corner. The delightful little sibling on Lafayette St. stands proudly on its own two feet, and if the dazzling design-defined by black-and-white tiles, tiny wood tables, and a bustling, worldly scene-makes Atla feel like a contemporary Mexican terrace, well that's the point. First things first: order a mezcal from the massive selection, then settle in to peruse the list of small plates. A party of two could easily sample every delicious morsel on the menu, but Chef Daniela Soto-Innes really rocks the Arctic char tostada; quinoa, yogurt, and tomatoes done pico de gallo-style; farro wheat and quail egg meatballs; as well as the spectacular chicken enchiladas."
"Arrogant Swine","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.arrogantswine.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A boon to this otherwise industrial warehouse neighborhood, Arrogant Swine’s whitewashed brick walls and rows of picnic tables steadily fill with hungry patrons. Striking exterior wall murals and the aroma of sweet smoke both impress from the approach. Heat lamps extend the season for savoring slow-cooked pork outdoors, with rock music and a smoke-fueled barbecue buzz in the background. Whole hog barbecue is the specialty here-smoked slow and whole over live embers, resulting in tender, glistening meat. The loin, shoulder, jowl, and more are then chopped or pulled and tossed with a Carolina-style vinegar sauce. Sides complete the downhome experience, especially their traditional cornpone (savory cornbread in an iron skillet with bacon drippings and slaw)."
"Aquavit","Two  Stars","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.aquavit.org","Two Stars • Excellent cooking, worth a detour","No detail goes unnoticed at this sleek beauty, where black-suited servers in waiting line the dining room, which is intimate without being crowded. The overall design of Aquavit is clean and contemporary—with dark floors, wood tabletops, and high-backed leather chairs. Courses arrive in equally beautiful, but minimalist, dishware like wood boxes, slate platters, and glazed earthenware. The kitchen does many things well, but what makes it one of the more unique in the city is the chef’s ability to take bold Scandinavian flavors like dill, lingonberry, smoke or brine, and soften them into balanced, whimsical and elegant dishes. Take for example, a sheet of raw Colorado Wagyu draped over pickled leeks and carefully strewn with pumpernickel croutons. Then delicately cooked and deliciously crisp Dover sole is plated with crisp apple, parsnip, and excellently seasoned pork cheek ragù for a veritable study in harmonious flavors. Finally, opt for the namesake aquavit, offered in house-made flavors like anise-caraway-fennel or fig-cardamom, to team with such treats as a ""nest"" of honey tuile threads cradling three small ""eggs"" composed of white chocolate and frozen goat cheese. Pure bliss, indeed."
"Angkor","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.angkornyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Connoisseurs of Southeast Asian cuisine, take note: in a city that prides itself on ethnic eats, this fresh bistro offers one of the few true places for Cambodian food in Manhattan. Inside, the stone-accented Angkor is lined in richly-stained wood and filled with woven rattan furnishings and Buddha figurines. Owned by Minh and Mandy Truong, the husband-wife team who ran Chelsea's Royal Siam for 20 years, this menu certainly shares DNA with other Southeast Asian restaurants, offering classic items like grilled, marinated meat skewers, sour soups, spicy salads, and curries. But there are also more unique items to be explored, like delicious stir-fried specialties from Siem Reap; or nyoam, a traditional Khmer noodle dish sauced with thick red fish curry."
"Asian Jewels","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.asianjewelsseafood.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Arguably the best dim sum in Flushing, this spectacular gem is an absolute must for anyone seeking serious seafood and very authentic Cantonese cooking. A longtime resident of 39th Avenue, the expansive dining room is outfitted with round, banquet-style tables, bamboo plants, and ornate chandeliers. Let the feasting begin with memorable crab-and-pork soup dumplings, before moving on to the thrill-inducing dim sum carts. Taste the likes of steamed rice rolls with honey-roast pork; pork spareribs with rice starch and black beans; chicken and ham wrapped in yuba; and poached jellyfish with scallions and sesame. The signature Dungeness crab- steamed and stir-fried with ginger and green onions, served with Japanese eggplant and garlic-is simply outstanding."
"Arharn Thai","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.thaiastoria.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","The look here may be demure with its pale pink walls and gilded artwork, but this gem serves up a bounty of bold, northern-leaning specialties. And though tables are draped in embroidered linen, glass tops encourage diners to partake in the flavor-packed cooking as lustily as they please. A shelf of snacks is the extent of the restaurant's retail component, but these will be the last thing on your mind after consuming their excellent gai yang sided by sweet chili sauce; or nua nam tok, a warm salad of grilled steak tossed with roasted rice powder, red onion slivers, and fragrant herbs. The yum woon sen combines glass noodles with stir-fried ground pork, fresh chilies, and a liberal amount of bright dressing redolent of lime and fish sauce."
"Almayass","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.almayassnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Armenian influences steer the Lebanese cuisine here to a unique and rather elegant place. While this family-run operation has numerous Middle Eastern locations, this is their sole U.S. outpost. Polished service befits the upscale room, installed with vivid artwork and tables generously sized for feasting. Beginning with a selection of fresh and flavorful meze is absolutely necessary. Cold options include kabis, an assortment of spicy pickled vegetables; and moutabbal Almayass, a magenta-colored spread of mashed beets seasoned with sesame paste, lemon, and garlic. Or opt for hot, succulent, and Armenian mantee-little pockets stuffed with beef, earthenware-baked, and doused with tart yogurt. A selection of Lebanese producers headlines the wine list."
"Amaranto","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.amarantobklyn.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Named for the staple grain of the Aztecs and emblazoned with a mural of Quetzalcoatl, this tidy but truly caliente restaurant makes its love of its homeland clear from first glance. Adding to the lure, the father-son duo delivers their own unique take on Mexican cuisine, which is irresistible at best. Most dishes here, from enchiladas to tamales, are sure to incorporate their excellent masa. Memelitas may begin with griddled dough layered with crispy chorizo, vegetables, pinto beans, and more. Then, superb tortillas are folded with shredded chicken and draped with dark and luscious mole poblano enriched with cacao, almonds and spices. A range of other moles include pipian verde that dresses deliciously tender short ribs in a pool of nutty richness."
"Aldea","One  Star","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.aldearestaurant.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","A perfect climate and great scenery— it’s easy to see the appeal of life on the Mediterranean. George Mendes’ cheerful restaurant may not transport you there, but you will leave feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat while deciding what to eat will delight in an appealing petisco or snack—the crisp and refreshing gin and tonic macaron for example—served to kick off the four-course meal. The menu reflects the seasons and is full of dishes to match that Southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than bacalhau—here served grilled and set over earthy-sweet sunchoke purée, finished tableside with enriched soy sauce. The kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes—try the grilled quail with butternut squash and pumpkin seeds. Aim for items that remain truer to their Portuguese heritage rather than Japanese embellishments. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz, but ask for the more intimate mezzanine level if on a date."
"Africa Kine","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.africakine.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Following the closure of the original location a few years ago, fans of Senegalese cuisine are happy to see the return of this West Harlem café run by a pair of Dakar natives. A giant fork and spoon hanging on the wall are whimsical decorative accents in a room of pale yellow hues and faux marble-topped tables, where placemats double as menus displaying Africa Kine's myriad offerings. Keep it simple with grilled fish or meat sided by salad, or opt for more succulent items such as peanut butter-enriched lamb mafe or suppa kandja (lamb and fish simmered in an okra and golden palm oil sauce). Note that some dishes are only available on certain nights, and although lunch is a more limited affair, Senegal's national treasure, thiebou djeun, is always on offer."
"Agern","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.agernrestaurant.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Even before disciples of the New Nordic creed started making pilgrimages to Copenhagen’s Noma restaurant it was clear that the winds of culinary change were blowing in from that direction. The ethos that has made the cooking in Scandinavia so influential—fierce adherence to seasonality and respect for nature’s larder—may not seem particularly ground-breaking but for many a chef and restaurateur it prompted some sort of epiphany. The good news is that, thanks to the great Dane Claus Meyer, you don’t need to fly there to find out more. Agern is hidden at the Vanderbilt Hall end of Grand Central Terminal but has been designed with such understated elegance that you quickly forget where you are. The restaurant also leads into the Nordic-themed “Great Northern Food Hall” so it won’t be long before everyone in this part of town is in cable knit sweaters, discussing their own understanding of “hygge.” Ingredients like havgus, söl and ymer may not be familiar to all; nor perhaps will be the liberal use of techniques like pickling, fermenting or smoking. But, under the aegis of Icelandic chef Gunnar Gíslason, the kitchen uses these methods to deliver sharper, more defined and more natural flavors."
"Allswell","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.allswellnyc.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","For remarkably good food and drinks, head to this rustic, farm-to-table favorite with the soul of a time past. The simple interior reflects the straightforward pleasure of this gastropub fare. Burgers are popular, but the cooking here is thoroughly delicious. Start with potato-ricotta gnocchi tossed with walnuts, wild mushrooms, and finished with rosemary oil for a smart and pleasing interplay of flavors. The veal piccata is also excellent, pounded thin and served in a marvelous lemon-caper sauce splashed with white wine, alongside artichoke hearts and green fava beans. An intensely chocolate-y tart with buckwheat crust is brought to an entirely new level with taste bud-tingly anise ice cream. Their always-changing frittatas are a brunchtime highlight."
"Al di Là","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.aldilatrattoria.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","When Al di Là opened nearly twenty years ago, it was a forward-thinking husband-and-wife operation serving rustic food to a gentrifying neighborhood. Today, it is every local's favorite spot for soul-satisfying pasta. This is a kitchen for that special kind of diner-one which is ruled by energy and ease. Lunches may bring a duo of insalata di farro tossed with roasted beets, red onion, spinach, goat cheese, and toasted pistachios paired with a daily panino such as pork belly with pickles, horseradish mayo, and salsa verde. Tables are laden with hearty and chewy ricotta cavatelli with smoky and enticingly charred cauliflower, anchovies, chili, and tomato sauce finished with grated pecorino. The room may show wear, but consider that part of its charm."
"Ai Fiori","One  Star","Over 75 USD","Very comfortable","http://www.aifiorinyc.com","One Star • High quality cooking, worth a stop","Elegantly accessed by a sweeping spiral staircase or the Langham Place hotel elevator, Ai Fiori stands proudly above its busy Fifth Avenue address. Walls of windows and espresso-dark polished wood dominate the space. The Carrara marble bar and lounge furnished with silvery tufted banquettes are ideal for solo diners; large florals, brown leather chairs, and square columns adorn the formal dining room. No matter where you sit, servers are attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf “F” and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, pastas here are masterful. Begin with perfectly al dente curls of trofie nero intertwined with a spicy Ligurian crustacean ragù of sepia and scallops. Crowned by spiced mollica, it boasts a perfect play on flavor and texture. Fish courses can be even more enticing. Dine on one of the brightest, freshest fluke crudos known to this city, served atop Meyer lemon breadcrumbs and enhanced by a generous dollop of American sturgeon caviar. End with a tartiletta di cioccolato, featuring a thin cocoa sable crust and topped with a dark Valrhona chocolate-covered marshmallow, for a delicious and fitting finale."
"Abyssinia","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.harlemethiopianfood.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Abyssinia's expansion couldn't be better timed, for the local Ethiopian population surrounding its Harlem location has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. Expanded digs mean no one leaves hungry, including the gluten-intolerant diners lining up for the injera-a sour-dough risen flatbread with a uniquely spongy texture that performs the task of cutlery, and is also ideal for sopping up all the amazing flavors from this authentic kitchen. The dining room is spacious and flooded with natural light; the staff gracious; and the décor simple, clean and functional. This is essentially light, healthy, and spicy cooking, and the best way to experience it is to come with a group and order a slew of entrées to sample. Whatever you do, save room for the delicious slow-cooked beef awaze tibs."
"Achilles Heel","","25 - 50 USD","Comfortable","http://www.achillesheelnyc.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","Ace restaurateur Andrew Tarlow (of Diner, Marlow & Sons, The Reynard and more) brings next-level bar food to a tavern in Greenpoint—and the result is predictably spectacular. Located near the East River, Achilles Heel is beautifully worn, with big windows and an authentic dockside tavern warmth. Chef Lee Desrosiers heads the tiny kitchen, where the menu is succinct but surprise dishes are common. A crisp three-bean salad is paired with thick aïoli and soft-crumb sourdough; while lobster mushrooms are pooled in a perfect tomato dashi. Don't miss the Hell Chicken (served on Sundays only)-an otherworldly chicken extravaganza that's smoked, grilled, braised, then grilled again, and served with chicken jus, chicken schmaltz and garlicky miso."

Behind the glass wall, his kitchen uses plenty of modern techniques to produce dishes that are perky, colorful and satisfying. The best options are those of international provenance, such as spinach spaghetti with broccoli and kale; and creamy tofu with crispy yuba and ponzu. White, bright but dotted with color, the room shouts freshness and vigor; the vibe is fun and hearteningly devoid of New Age smugness or pious worthiness. Just check your coat and your prejudices on your way in."

Our most delightful places","http://www.nycprimerib.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","Brendan Sodikoff's lovely newcomer makes the case that New York should be home to more Chicago influencers. It may be a meat-centric spot named for its street address, but the intimate size and modest exterior make this feel like a charming hideaway. The mood of the staff is warm and welcoming. Some dishes may break with tradition but offer tasty results, like spaghetti carbonara twirled with pecorino and smoky guanciale set beneath a silky fried egg. Others are firmly footed classics, like a phenomenal bone-in Porterhouse for two, served alongside truffle potatoes, creamed spinach, and a whole head of roasted garlic. Bookend your meal with wonderful cocktails and desserts-perhaps a dense wedge of Valrhona dark chocolate pie in an Oreo-cookie crust."
"2nd Avenue Deli","","Under 25 USD","Comfortable","http://www.2ndavedeli.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","While the décor may be more deli-meets-deco and there's a tad less attitude, this food is every bit as good as it was on Second Avenue. Ignore the kvetching and know that this is a true Jewish deli filled with personality, and one of the best around by far. The menu remains as it should: kosher, meat-loving, and non-dairy with phenomenal pastrami, pillowy rye, tangy mustard, perfect potato pancakes, and fluffy matzoh balls in comforting broth. Have the best of both worlds with the soup and half-sandwich combination. Carve a nook during midday rush, when in pour the crowds. The deli also does takeout (popular with the midtown lunch bunch), and delivery (grandma's latkes at your door). Giant platters go equally well to a bris or brunch."

This dark and sophisticated izakaya is tucked down a side street in bustling midtown. Once inside, grab an intimate table for two or join the crowd at the open kitchen counter surrounding the smoky robata grill. The waiters talk up the omakase, but it's worth trusting your own instincts to guide you on a personalized tour through their authentic offerings. The sukiyaki is a must-try seasonal special of tender marbled beef served in a hot pot bobbing with a beaten egg, tofu, vegetables, and noodles. Other favorites may include smoky bamboo shoots fresh off the robata with shaved bonito; as well as their legendary tsukune, a tender ground chicken meatball brushed with teriyaki and dipped in raw egg."

Couples often settle in the lounge near the fireplace, while larger groups gather in the elevated dining room for platters of hot antipasti. White leather chairs, cotton panels, and rustic tables lend a breezy feel. Italian and Italian-American classics span the wide menu-from grilled calamari with a tomato sauce topped with peppers and olives, to ridged tubes of manicotti stuffed with ricotta, pecorino, and cooked in a meaty Bolognese, finished with rich béchamel. Brick-oven pizzas are always worthy orders, especially the Calabrese decked with spicy soppressata and a few dollops of mozzarella."
"21 Club","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable. Our most delightful places","http://www.21club.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","This fabled institution has been in business for over 85 years, and there's nothing slowing it down. Once a speakeasy, 21 Club has wined and dined everyone, from movie stars and music moguls to moneyed locals. Add to that its lantern-holding jockeys, townhouse exterior, leather- and wood-paneled dining room, and know this is a classic through and through. Gentlemen, don't forget to don your jackets here. The menu is a perfect accompaniment to the setting featuring ""Clayton's jumbo lump crab meat"" dabbed with mustard and topped with cucumber; or splendid oxtail ravioli in a rich bone marrow-brown butter sauce. The Dutch apple pie with cheddar crumble and sarsaparilla ice cream offers a delightful contrast in taste, texture, and will guarantee your favor."
"15 East","","50 - 75 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.15eastrestaurant.com","The Plate • Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: a good meal","A Japanese restaurant divided in two: you can perch at the counter and watch the sushi chefs in action, or you can go next door and sit at a table in a slickly run, narrow room decked out in earthy tones. Either way, you'll be well looked after by an attentive team. The menu is also divided-between sushi and sashimi from the bar, and hot dishes from the kitchen. There is an impressive selection of the former, with the sashimi being particularly worthy. The hot dishes range from the traditional to the more innovative and adapted. Avoid the over-generously battered tempura and go instead for the soba noodles, made in house and served with a choice of topping such as uni or ikura, or the rich squid ink risotto with cuttlefish."
"21 Greenpoint","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.21greenpoint.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","A big and bright red wood-burning oven is not merely a visual centerpiece at 21 Greenpoint, it is also the soul of their thoroughly pleasing American fare. This is where those fresh breads and pizze are baked just as meats and a tantalizing array of root vegetables are roasted. The menu changes daily and the kitchen is notably accommodating, so vegan/vegetarian variations are easily made. Don't miss the Sunday night prix-fixe, offering six excellent courses like a frittata, peppery pork shoulder soup with foraged mushrooms, and more for a mere $21. Nowhere else can you find this level of delicious American cooking at such a price. This may be a relative newcomer, but it has a familiar feel with plank floors, colorful mosaics, and pleasantly disheveled walls."
"Alta Calidad","","25 - 50 USD","Quite comfortable","http://www.altacalidadbk.com","Bib Gourmand • Inspectors’ favourites for good value","What’s in a name? Well, at Akhtar Nawab’s contemporary Mexican restaurant, it’s “high quality.” Literally. This supremely talented chef takes thoroughly Mexican dishes and shakes them up just enough for a satisfying surprise. His creativity is boundless but never veers out of focus. Case in point? Crispy skate tacos smothered with smoky salsa and pickled ramps or the pumpkin blossom quesadilla. Other standouts include the oh-so-tender lamb ribs, shellacked in Coca-Cola for that glorious hint of caramel, as well as the meaty fluke ceviche enhanced by habanero and mandarin. Like Nawab's creativity at the burner, the menu is seemingly limitless, offering an array of plates you'll want to sample. Bring a friend, or three, to justify ordering more."
